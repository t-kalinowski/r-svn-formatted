TITLE(symplot @@ Produce a Symmetry Plot)
USAGE(
symplot(vec)
)
ARGUMENTS(
ARG(vec @@ a numeric vector.)
)
DESCRIPTION(
The symmetry plot is based on the fact that for symmetric distributions
the distance between the median and EQN(greekalpha)-th quantile is the same as
the distance between the median and the EQN(1 - greekalpha)-th quantile.
The function produced a plot of
EQN(median - SUB(q,greekalpha)) versus
EQN(SUB(q,{ ( 1 - greekalpha ) }) - median) for EQN(greekalpha) 
between 0 and 0.5.
If the distribution underlying the data is symmetric,
the points in this plot should fall close to the 45 degree line.
Large deviations from the 45 degree line indicate a lack of symmetry.
