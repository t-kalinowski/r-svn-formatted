=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk or via email to
r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

-- 4. works the same as S
-- 5. Splus gives NA and the if(class(z)=="repeated") doesn't work in either

-- 7.  seems to do what Jim wants now
--1.0.0
-- 1. is S-compatible and has been altered to make R incompatible
