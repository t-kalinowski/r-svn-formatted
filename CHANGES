		  CHANGES IN VERSION R VERSION 0.60

R is now an official part of the GNU project.  To quote RMS

	``I hereby dub R GNU software!''

And a golden glow descended on the R core, and all their sins
were washed away ...


NEW FEATURES

    o	There has been a major change in directory structure
	masterminded by Kurt Hornik.

    o   Use of "dimnames" and "names" attributes on one dimensional
	arrays will now produce identical results.  This means that
	you really don't need differentiate between vectors and
        one dimensional arrays.


BUG FIXES

    o	The following type of assignment to data frame subsets

		z <- data.frame(x=rnorm(10),y=rnorm(10),z=rnorm(10))
		z[,1:2] <- matrix(1:20,nc=2)

	was producing incorrect results.  The solution was to wrap
	an implicit "as.data.frame" around the RHS.

    o	There was a swap of coordinates internally in "mtext" which
	meant that labels were coming out in the wrong place.  Fixed.
