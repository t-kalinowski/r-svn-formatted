		  CHANGES IN VERSION R VERSION 0.60

R is now an official part of the GNU project.  To quote RMS

	``I hereby dub R GNU software!''

And a golden glow descended on the R core, and all their sins
were washed away ...


NEW FEATURES

    o	There has been a major change in directory structure
	masterminded by Kurt Hornik.

    o   The use of "names" on one dimensional arrays will now produce
	sensible results.  This means that for most purposes, one
	one dimensional arrays can be treated like vectors.

    o	We have a applied a patch from mward@wolf.hip.berkeley.edu
	which should substantially improve the speed of (vector)
	arithmetic.

    o	The modeling formula handler has been expanded so that it
	accepts y ~ 0 + x as a "through the origin" specification.
	models with no parameters are now acceptable.

    o	"cov", "cor" and "var" now produce a matrix result if either
	of their x or y arguments is a matrix.  Dimnames are propagated
	in a sensible fashion.

BUG FIXES

    o	"approx" and "approxfun", have had some minor adjustments.
	which fix the interpretation of the rule= argument.  The
	code for piecewise constant case is now internal C code
	that than interpreted.  This should boost performance in
	this case.

    o	There has been a minor fixup of "model.frame" to ensure that
	subsets, weights, etc are handled properly.

    o	Model fitting of the form

		lm(y~., data=df)
		glm(y~., data=df)

	will now work.  The RHS of the model will consist of an
	additive model containing all (non-respose) variabels in the
	given data frame.

    o	The following type of assignment to data frame subsets

		z <- data.frame(x=rnorm(10),y=rnorm(10),z=rnorm(10))
		z[,1:2] <- matrix(1:20,nc=2)

	was producing incorrect results.  The solution was to wrap
	an implicit "as.data.frame" around the RHS.

    o   "[.data.frame" no longer has a default drop=TRUE argument.
	This means that subsetting a data frame with "[" will always
	yield a data frame.

    o	There was a swap of coordinates internally in "mtext" which
	meant that labels were coming out in the wrong place.  Fixed.

    o   Syntax errors in parse(text="...") would cause R to terminate
	with a segmentation violation.  This no longer happens, although
	the result is still not perfect (the parse() returns).
	This will be fixed by a future parse rewrite.
