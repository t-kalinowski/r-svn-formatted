		  CHANGES IN VERSION R VERSION 0.60

R is now an official part of the GNU project.  To quote RMS

	``I hereby dub R GNU software!''

And a golden glow descended on the R core, and all their sins
were washed away ...


NEW FEATURES

    o	There has been a major change in directory structure
	masterminded by Kurt Hornik.


BUG FIXES

    o	The following type of assignment to data frame subsets

		z <- data.frame(x=rnorm(10),y=rnorm(10),z=rnorm(10))
		z[,1:2] <- matrix(1:20,nc=2)

	was producing incorrect results.  The solution was to wrap
	an implicit "as.data.frame" around the RHS.

    o	There was a swap of coordinates internally in "mtext" which
	meant that labels were coming out in the wrong place.  Fixed.
