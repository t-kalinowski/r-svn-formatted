		  CHANGES IN VERSION R VERSION 0.60

R is now an official part of the GNU project.  To quote RMS

	``I hereby dub R GNU software!''

And a golden glow descended on the R core, and all their sins
were washed away ...


NEW FEATURES

    o	There has been a major change in directory structure
	masterminded by Kurt Hornik.

    o   The use of "names" on one dimensional arrays will now produce
	sensible results.  This means that for most purposes, one
	one dimensional arrays can be treated like vectors.

    o	We have a applied a patch from mward@wolf.hip.berkeley.edu
	which should substantially improve the speed of (vector)
	arithmetic.

BUG FIXES

    o	There has been a minor fixup of "model.frame" to ensure that
	subsets, weights, etc are handled properly.

    o	Model fitting of the form

		lm(y~.,data=df)
		glm(y~.,data=df)

	will now work.  The RHS of the model will consist of an
	additive model containing all (non-respose) variabels in the
	given data frame.

    o	The following type of assignment to data frame subsets

		z <- data.frame(x=rnorm(10),y=rnorm(10),z=rnorm(10))
		z[,1:2] <- matrix(1:20,nc=2)

	was producing incorrect results.  The solution was to wrap
	an implicit "as.data.frame" around the RHS.

    o   "[.data.frame" no longer has a default drop=TRUE argument.
	This means that subsetting a data frame with "[" will always
	yield a data frame.

    o	There was a swap of coordinates internally in "mtext" which
	meant that labels were coming out in the wrong place.  Fixed.

    o   Syntax errors in parse(text="...") would cause R to terminate
	with a segmentation violation.  This no longer happens, although
	the result is still not perfect (the parse() returns ...).
	Help is on the way.
