The primary R distribution site is

	ftp://stat.auckland.ac.nz/pub/R/

However, due to high internet fees in NZ, please don't use this server
unless it is absolutely necessary.

which carry identical material, consisting of the R distribution(s),
the contributed extensions, documentation for R, and binaries.

CRAN also contains a DAILY snapshot of the latest R sources.
