		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.1.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	attach() now works for R data files.

    o	R (under Unix) can be sent SIGUSR1 to quit and
	save or SIGUSR2 to quit and save without running .Last and
	on.exit expressions.

    o	Option for user-supplied normal random generator in RNGkind().

    o	New functions chartr() for general-purpose character translation
	in character vectors, and tolower() and toupper() for converting
	alphabetic characters to lower-case and upper-case, respectively.

    o	Command line option `-g' can now be used as short version of
	`--gui'.

    o	nlm() can now take additional arguments in ... to be passed to f.

    o	cor.test(method="spearman") might give slightly better P values,
	since it now relies on pnorm() (with proper tail) instead of alnorm.

    o	Internal cleanup of do_lapply.

    o	Added col option to rug.

    o	Internally using global R_Expressions [getOption("expressions")]
	dramatically speeds up eval.c.

    o	New function max.col() from MASS, thanks to V&R.

    o	CVS logs on http://developer.r-project.org/R.cvslog

    o	str(.) has a new optional argument "nchar.max = 128" and truncates
	strings longer than that.  Also eliminated a few minor glitches.

    o   boxplot() returns (and bxp() accepts) a list containing the summary
        statistics for the boxes (changed from a list of elements one for
        each box).

    o   plot.formula searches for a plot method for the left-side of the
	formula before searching for a plot method for the right-side of
	the formula.

    o	Initial support for C++ source code in add-on packages under Unix.

    o	New argument `extend' to window() (and updated documentation).

    o	file="|cmd" is allowed (to pipe output to `cmd'), under cat()
	and postscript() and functions that use them (for example, write()).

    o	postscript(print.it=TRUE) now does print the plot file.

    o	postscript(onefile=FALSE) now produces multiple separate files.

    o	image() has a new argument "breaks" and divides the zlim range
	into equal-length intervals.

    o	write.table() can now write CSV files in the format Excel expects.

    o	The X11 support code is now in a separate shared library, and
	flag --gui=none will run R without X11 support (and so x11()
	and data.entry() will not be available).  R BATCH sets --gui=none.

    o	Configuring without X (e.g. --without-x) does work (at last).
	configure will report if X11 support has been included.
	If R has been built without X11 the default GUI is "none".

    o	GNOME support files have moved from src/gnome to src/unix/gnome:
	x11() is currently unavailable under --gui=GNOME.

    o	New device xfig() to produce XFig files.

    o	Added ability to use the graphics device driver to perform
	horizontal justification of strings.  This is used in the
	postscript() and xfig() drivers and will lead to more accurate
	placing of centred or right-justified strings.


BUG FIXES

    o	The Mathlib functions now use exactly the same values for
	+/-Inf, NaN and NA as the rest of R in all cases.

    o	Improved automatic remaking.

    o	Fixed problem in usemethod() where CAR(call) could be non-symbol.

    o	is.qr() checks not only for $qr, but also for $rank & $qraux, PR#482.

    o	postscript() now uses the options "papersize" and "printcmd"
	rather than the values of R_PAPERSIZE in the environment 
	and R_PRINTCMD found at build time.

    o	system() is now (partially) functional on systems without popen.

    o   count.fields and read.table now have the same default quote = "\"'".

    o	postscript() now makes use of kerning information in computing
	string widths.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.0.1

BUG FIXES

    o	pgamma(Inf, 1, Inf) gives NaN instead of an infinite loop, PR#462.

    o	Inline xaxt and yaxt parameters were ignored.

    o	Setting the normal RNG was not always recorded in .Random.seed.

    o	\link[pkg]{foo} links were wrongly translated to HTML.

    o	Direct use of show.data() with no args was incorrect.

    o	print.coefmat does sensible things if options
	show.signif.stars and show.coef.Pvalues are not set correctly.

    o	x <- list(a=1, b=2) ; x["c"] <- 3 now (again) stretches the list
	rather than give a "subscript out of bounds" error.

    o	Models with response appearing on rhs could cause segfault.

    o	as.data.frame.matrix will now ensure the columns added have
	non-empty names.

    o	Some (strange?) model formulas could cause memory corruption
	(thanks to John Fox for digging this up).

    o	Matrix multiplication in cases such as 1:3 %*% t(1:2) is accepted.

    o	Options --nsize and --vsize to R CMD check gave warning
	messages and only one was accepted.

    o	The autoload()s during startup are "wrapped" such
	that conflicting objects don't break startup.

    o	cor.test(*, meth="spear") {pkg ctest} now works (again) for n <= 6

    o	scale = 0 in biplot.princomp() now works.

    o	The scores given by princomp(, cor = TRUE) and the rotated
	values given by prcomp(, scale = TRUE) are now computed from the
	scaled data.

    o	barplot now works okay when length(col) < length(legend.txt),
	thanks to Ben Bolker, PR#494.

    o	kernel("dirichlet", m=10, r=1) in package ts now works.

    o	save/restore of	 environments containing "..." object should
	work now.

    o   qhyper should work better for large N.

    o   as.matrix.data.frame no longer escapes quotes in character
        vectors.

    o   qbinom(1-1e-16, n, p) looped for ever.

    o   R would try to save the readline history at the end of
        non-interactive sessions, causing crashes on some systems.

    o   Subtle roundoff problems caused arrays to be allocated short in
        loess.c in some cases, leading to segfaults.

    o	loessf.f in modreg defined DSIGN unecessarily and this caused
	a conflict on AIX.
