		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.1.0


NEW FEATURES

   o	Faster algorithm in summaryRprof().


INSTALLATION CHANGES

   o	-D__NO_MATH_INLINES is only used on older ix86 glibc-based
	systems which need it (tested at configure time).

   o	R_XTRA_[CF]FLAGS are now used during the configuration tests,
	and [CF]PICFLAGS if --enable-R-shlib was specified.  This
	ensures that features such as inlining are only used if the
	compilation flags specified support them.  (PR#7257)

   o	If makeinfo >= 4.5 is not available, placeholders are created
	for the HTML manuals in doc/manual (rather than empty files
	as in 2.0.0).


BUG FIXES

   o	Configuring for Tcl/TK makes use of ${TK_LIB_SPEC} ${TK_LIBS}
	not ${TK_LIB_SPEC} ${TK_XLIBSW}, which is correct for
	recent versions of Tk, but conceivably not for old
	tkConfig.sh files.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.0.0 patched


INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o   Building on Alpha OSF/1 no longer forces the C flag -std1,
	which appears to be no longer needed.  (PR#7257)

    o	The compiler flag -mieee-fp is no longer used on i386 Linux
	(these days it is only passed to the linker and was only
	invoked for compilation steps).

   o	If makeinfo >= 4.5 is not available, warnings are given that
	some of the HTML manuals will be empty, and the index page
	given by help.start() will link to CRAN versions of those manuals.


BUG FIXES

    o	model.frame.default() takes row names from the response
	variable if that has suitable names and there is no 'data'
	argument.  (This follows S but was not previously implemented
	in R.)

    o	write.table() was not respecting the 'dec' argument for complex
	numbers.

    o	write.table() printed a mixture of numeric and complex numbers
	as all complex.  (PR#7260)

    o   R CMD INSTALL failed with versioned installs on packages which
	save images (only).

    o   dlogis() gave NaN not 0 for large negative arguments.

    o   Importing from another namespace was broken for versioned
	installs, incorrectly reporting something like 
	"package 'imported_from' does not have a name space".

    o   The GNOME interface under Linux/Unix was broken. (PR#7276)

    o	For the jpeg/png devices under Linux/Unix, under certain rare
	circumstances clipping needed to be cleared before starting a
	new page.  (PR#7270, which has been the case since the devices
	were introduced in 1.1.0.)

    o	First lattice plot (first grid.newpage() call) did not start
	a new page IF there had been a previous traditional graphics
	plot (on the same device).
