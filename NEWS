		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.1.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	attach now works for R data files.

    o	R (at least under Unix) can be sent SIGUSR1 to quit and
	save or SIGUSR2 to quit and save without running .Last and
	on.exit expressions.

    o	Option for user-supplied normal random generator in RNGkind().

    o	New functions chartr() for general-purpose character translation
	in character vectors, and tolower() and toupper() for converting
	alphabetic characters to lower-case and upper-case, respectively.

    o	Command line option `-g' can now be used as short version of
	`--gui'.

    o	nlm() can now take additional arguments in ... to be passed to f.

    o	cor.test(methoed="spearman") might give slightly better P values,
	since it now relies on pnorm() (with proper tail) instead of alnorm.

    o	internal cleanup of do_lapply

    o	added col option to rug

    o	internally using global R_Expressions [getOption("expressions")]
	dramatically speeds up eval.c.

    o	new function max.col() from MASS, thanks to V&R.

    o	CVS logs on http://developer.r-project.org/R.cvslog

    o	str(.) has a new optional argument "nchar.max = 128" and truncates
	strings longer than that.  Also eliminated a few minor glitches.

    o   boxplot returns (and bxp accepts) a list containing the summary
        statistics for the boxes (changed from a list of elements one for
        each box).

    o   plot.formula searches for a plot method for the left-side of the
	formula before searching for a plot method for the right-side of
	the formula

    o	Initial support for C++ source code in add-on packages under Unix


BUG FIXES

    o	The Mathlib functions now use exactly the same values for
	+/-Inf, NaN and NA as the rest of R in all cases.

    o	Improved automatic remaking.

    o	Fixed problem in usemethod where CAR(call) could be non-symbol

    o	AIX building of modreg {duplicate dsign()} fixed.

    o	is.qr() checks not only for $qr, but also for $rank & $qraux, PR#482.
