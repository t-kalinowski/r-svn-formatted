		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.1.0


USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	box plots {by boxplot() or bxp()} now have the median line three
	times the normal line width in order to distinguish it from the
	quartile ones.


NEW FEATURES

    o	Faster algorithm in summaryRprof().

    o	update.packages() and old.packages() have a new option
	'checkBuilt' to allow packages installed under earlier
	versions of R to be updated.

    o	na.contiguous() is now (S3) generic with first argument
	renamed to 'object'.

    o	Plotmath now allows underline in expressions.  (PR#7286,
	contributed by Uwe Ligges.)

    o	BATCH on Unix no longer sets --gui="none" as the X11 module
	is only loaded if needed.

    o	The X11 module (and the hence X11(), jpeg() and png() devices
	and the X-based dataentry editor) is now in principle
	available under all Unix GUIs except --gui="none", and this is
	reflected in capabilities().  capabilities("X11") determines
	if an X server can be accessed, and so is more likely to be
	accurate.

    o	binomial() has a new "cauchit" link (suggested by Roger Koenker).

    o	ecdf() now has jumps of the correct size (a multiple of 1/n)
	if there are ties.  (wished by PR#7292).

    o	Printing of arrays now honours the 'right' argument if there
	are more than two dimensions.

    o	Tabular printing of numbers now has headers right-justified, as
	they were prior to version 1.7.0 (spotted by Rob Baer).

    o	dir.create() has a new argument 'recursive' serving the same
	purpose as Unix's mkdir -p.

    o	scatter.smooth() and loess.smooth() now handle missing values
	in their inputs.

    o	The use of UseMethod() with no argument was not documented on
	the help page and is now regarded as an error.

    o	Added colorRamp() and colorRampPalette() for color interpolation.

    o	install.packages() and friends now accept a vector of URLs for
	'repos' or 'contriburl' and get the newest available version of
	a package from the first repository on the list in which it is
	found.	The argument 'CRAN' is still accepted, but deprecated.

	New function new.packages() to report uninstalled packages
	available at the requested repositories.

	New function available.packages(), similar to CRAN.packages()
	but for use with multiple repositories.

    o	New argument 'immediate.' to warning() to send an immediate
	warning.

    o	file.append() has been tuned, including for the case of
	appending many files to a single file.

    o	subset() now has a method for matrices, similar to that for
	data frames.

    o	install.packages() no longer asks if downloaded packages
	should be deleted: they will be deleted at the end of the
	session anyway (and can be deleted by the user at any time).

    o	R CMD check will now work on a source tarball and prints out
	information about the version of R and the package.

    o	New function recordGraphics() to encapsulate calculations
	and graphics output together on graphics engine display list.
	To be used with care.

    o	kmeans() now returns an object of class "kmeans" which has a
	print() method.

	Two alternative algorithms have been implemented.

	If the number of centres is supplied, it has a new option of
	multiple random starts.

    o	is.all.equal() convenience function to be used for programming.

    o	unclass() is no longer allowed for environments and external
	pointers (since these cannot be copied and so unclass() was
	destructive of its argument).  You can still change the
	"class" attribute.

    o	choose(n,k) and lchoose(.) now also work for arbitrary (real) n in
	accordance with the general binomial theorem.  choose(*,k) is more
	accurate (and faster) for small k.

    o	as.dist() and cophenetic() are now generic, and the latter has a
        new method for objects of class "dendrogram".

    o	as.ts() is now generic.

    o   New function convertColors() maps between color spaces. 
	colorRamp() uses it.

    o	as.ts() is now generic.
    
    o	legend() now accepts positioning by keyword, e.g. "topleft", 
    	and can put a title within the legend.  (Suggested by Elizabeth
    	Purdom in PR#7400.)

    o	remove.packages() can now remove bundles.

    o	Lazy-loading databases are now cached in memory at first use:
	this enables R to run much faster from slow file systems such
	as USB flash drives.  There is a small (less than 2Mb)
	increase in default memory usage.


UTILITIES

    o	New functions mirror2html() and checkCRAN().

    o	R CMD check has a new option '--use-valgrind'.

	R CMD check now checks that Fortran and C++ files have LF
	line endings, as well as C files.

    o	tools:::.install_package_code_files() (used to collate R files
	when installing packages) ensures files are separated by a
	line feed.

    o	vignette() now returns an object of class "vignette" whose
        print() method opens the corresponding PDF file.  The edit()
        method can be used to open the code of the vignette in an
        editor.

    o	R CMD build now changes src files to LF line endings if necessary.

    o	R CMD INSTALL on Unix has a new option '--build' matching 
	that on Windows, to package as tarball the installed package.

    o	R CMD build now behaves consistently between source and binary
	builds: in each case it prepares a source directory and then
	either packages that as a tarball or call R CMD INSTALL
	--build on the prepared sources.

	This means that R CMD build --binary now respects
	.Rbuildignore and will rebuild vignettes (unless the option
	--no-vignettes is used).

	[Currently R CMD build --binary does not work for bundles.
	On Windows Rcmd INSTALL --build works, and on Unix
	R CMD INSTALL is not able to install a binary bundle.]


DOCUMENTATION

    o	File doc/html/faq.html no longer exists, and doc/manual/R-FAQ.html
	(which has active links to other manuals) is used instead.
	(If makeinfo >= 4.5 is not available, the version on CRAN is
	linked to.)

    o	Manual 'Writing R Extensions' has further details on writing
	new front-ends for R using the new public header files.

    o	There are no longer any restrictions on characters in the
	\name{} field of a .Rd file: in particular _ is supported.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	There are new public C/C++ header files Rinterface.h and
	R_ext/RStartup.h for use with external GUIs.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	The aqua module for MacOS X has been removed: --with-aqua now
	refers to the unbundled Cocoa GUI.

    o	Capabilities "bzip2", "GNOME, "libz" and "PCRE" are defunct.

    o	Capability "IEEE754" is deprecated.

    o	The 'CRAN' argument to update.packages(), old.packages(),
	new.packages(), download.packages() and install.packages() is
	deprecated in favour of 'repos', which is the new first
	argument (so this is only relevant for calls with named args).

    o	The S3 methods for getting and setting names of "dist" objects
        have been removed (as they provided names with a different
        length than the "dist" object itself).


INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	R_XTRA_[CF]FLAGS are now used during the configuration tests,
	and [CF]PICFLAGS if --enable-R-shlib was specified.  This
	ensures that features such as inlining are only used if the
	compilation flags specified support them.  (PR#7257)

    o	Files FAQ, RESOURCES, doc/html/resources.html are no longer in
	the SVN sources but are made by 'make dist'.

    o	The GNOME GUI is unbundled, currently available by Subversion only.

    o	Configuring without having the recommended packages is now an
	error unless --with-recommended-packages=no is used.

    o	Configure tries harder to find a minimal set of FLIBS.  Under
	some circumstances this may remove from R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	path elements that ought to have specified in LDFLAGS (but
	were not).


PACKAGE INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	The Contains: field of the DESCRIPTION file of package bundles
	is now installed, so later checks can find out if the package
	is complete.


BUG FIXES

    o	Configuring for Tcl/Tk makes use of ${TK_LIB_SPEC} ${TK_LIBS}
	not ${TK_LIB_SPEC} ${TK_XLIBSW}, which is correct for
	recent versions of Tk, but conceivably not for old
	tkConfig.sh files.

    o	detach() was not recomputing the methods for primitives
	correctly.

    o	"expression" partly fixed in basic classes, so S4 classes
	can extend these (but "expression" is pretty broken as a
	vector class in R).

    o	Collected warnings had messages with unneeded trailing space.

    o	Methods for primitive functions must be exported from
	namespaces; this is now done automatically.
	Note that is.primitive() is now in "base", not "methods" anymore.

    o   package grid:

	- Fixed bug in grid.text() when "rot" argument has length 0.
          (reported by Emmanuel Paradis)

    o	str() removed any class from environment objects.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.0.1 patched



NEW FEATURES

    o	warnings() now looks only in the workspace for `last.warning'
	(suggested by PR#7363).

    o	The search for browsers now starts with firefox, and has mozilla
	ahead of netscape.


PACKAGE INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	A package DESCRIPTION file which contains a Built field (it
	should not!) is now worked around, with loud warnings.


BUG FIXES

    o	split() was accepting raw and list vectors as input, but
	not populating the output correctly.

	split() now handles vectors with names internally and so is
	almost as fast as on vectors without names (and maybe 100x
	faster than before).

    o	subset() now throws an error if its 'subset' argument is not
	logical whereas it could appear to work and give wrong answers
	with e.g. a numeric 'subset' argument.

    o	sum(), max(), min(), prod(), any() and all() were incorrectly
	using partial matching for their na.rm argument.

    o	kmeans() now ensures that the initial cluster centers it chooses
	are distinct.

    o	text()'s default method could segfault if passed 0-length coordinates.

    o	R CMD INSTALL (Unix) was sometimes leaving a temporary dir
	behind.  (PR#7230)

    o	read.table() could fail when the row.names were looking like numbers.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.0.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	Platform equivalence in library() is tested by a new function
	testPlatformEquivalence() which ignores the 'vendor' field and
	can be customized by cognescenti.

    o   The assignment form of split() allows recycling of vectors
	within the value list. In particular, things like
	    split(x, g) <- lapply(split(x, g), mean)
	now work


DOCUMENTATION

    o	Manual `Writing R Extensions' has new sections on writing
	portable packages and on writing new front-ends for R -- the
	latter will be more comprehensive in R 2.1.0 which has new
	public header files.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	The aqua module in MacOS X is deprecated.

    o	Capabilities "bzip2", "GNOME, "libz" and "PCRE" are deprecated.

    o	The GNOME GUI on Unix-alikes is deprecated as part of R;
	it will be available in another form as from R 2.1.0.

    o	The undocumented use of UseMethod() with no argument is now
	formally deprecated.


INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	Building on Alpha OSF/1 no longer forces the C flag -std1,
	which appears to be no longer needed.  (PR#7257)

    o	The compiler flag -mieee-fp is no longer used on i386 Linux
	(these days it is only passed to the linker and was only
	invoked for compilation steps).

    o	-D__NO_MATH_INLINES is only used on older ix86 glibc-based
	systems which need it (tested at configure time).  This leads to
	small improvements in speed and accuracy on modern systems.

    o	If makeinfo >= 4.5 is not available, warnings are given that
	some of the HTML manuals will be missing, and the index page
	given by help.start() will link to CRAN versions of those manuals.

    o	Files aclocal.m4 and acinclude.m4 used in maintainer builds
	are not longer included in the distribution.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	It was not clear in 'Writing R Extensions' that some of the
	entry points in the 'Utilities' section were not declared in
	<R.h> (they were in <R_ext/Applic.h>).  Now all the entry
	points in that section are declared in <R_ext/Utils.h>,
	included by <R.h>.


BUG FIXES

    o   The grid.grab() function in package grid would throw an error
	if there were no viewports pushed (now returns NULL).

    o	model.frame.default() takes row names from the response
	variable if that has suitable names and there is no 'data'
	argument.  (This follows S but was not previously implemented
	in R.)

    o	write.table() was not respecting the 'dec' argument for complex
	numbers.

    o	write.table() printed a mixture of numeric and complex numbers
	as all complex.	 (PR#7260)

    o	R CMD INSTALL failed with versioned installs on packages which
	save images (only).

    o	dlogis() gave NaN not 0 for large negative arguments.

    o	Importing from another namespace was broken for versioned
	installs, incorrectly reporting something like
	"package 'imported_from' does not have a name space".

    o	The GNOME interface under Linux/Unix was broken. (PR#7276)

    o	For the jpeg/png devices under Linux/Unix, under certain rare
	circumstances clipping needed to be cleared before starting a
	new page.  (PR#7270, which has been the case since the devices
	were introduced in 1.1.0.)

    o	First lattice plot (first grid.newpage() call) did not start
	a new page IF there had been a previous traditional graphics
	plot (on the same device).

    o	Using install.packages() to install the same package to more
	than one library gave an incorrect warning message.  (If there
	were two or more such packages it might give an error.)

    o	.packages(all.available=TRUE) returned packages with an invalid
	version field in their DESCRIPTION whereas .find.packages() and
	packageDescription() did not.  Now all do not.

    o	packageDescription() now correctly reports that a package does
	not exist, rather than that its DESCRIPTION file is 'missing
	or broken'.

    o	'make dist' from builddir != sourcedir was copying not linking
	recommended packages to *.tgz.

    o	Slots in prototype objects can inherit from locally defined
	classes (which were not being found correctly before).

    o	Several fixes to the behavior of as() when there are either
	coerce= or replace= methods supplied in a call to
	setIs(). Related fixes to setIs() to handle correctly previous
	methods, if there were any.

    o	splinefun(1[0], 1[0])(1) doesn't segfault anymore (PR#7290).
	spline() and splinefun() now also work with missing values by
	omiting them.

    o	ecdf() was failing on inputs containing NAs. (Part of PR#7292)

    o	tools:::.install_package_description was splitting the Built:
	field across lines on platforms with very long names.

    o	capabilities() was wrong for the Aqua GUI on MacOS X.

    o   Using Rprof() with a non-writable 'file' argument is now a
	non-fatal error and does not abort R.

    o   binom.test() did not deparse its arguments early enough such
        that the reported data were ugly if x was a table.

    o	Systems based on glibc, including those using R's substitute for
	strptime, were handling strptime("2001", "%Y") incorrectly, in
	some cases crashing.  R's substitute code has been corrected
	(but problems may remain if glibc is used).  See the ?strptime
	for what should happen (which is system-specific).

    o	untrace() after trace() failed if package 'methods' was attached.
	(PR#7301)

    o	summary.stepfun() was reporting for n > 6 summaries of the
	knots and levels as the actual values.  Both print() and
	summary() methods called the constant values "step heights",
	although they were not the heights of the steps.

    o	is.na/is.nan() were giving spurious warnings if applied to a
	raw vector.

    o	is.atomic() gave incorrect result (false) for a raw vector.

    o	rank() and order() accepted raw and list inputs, but did not
	give a sensible answer (always 1:n).  Similarly, partial sorts
	of a raw vector were accepted but did nothing.

    o	require() without a version argument tried for an unversioned
	load of a package even though a versioned install was already
	loaded.  This often led to a message that a required package
	was being loaded when it was not actually being loaded.

    o	str(<S4.object>) made use of attributes() instead of slot(),
	and hence didn't properly print NULL slots.

    o	contrib.url() now handles URLs ending in '/' correctly.

    o	str() removed any class from externalptr objects.

    o	logLik() and hence AIC() failed or gave incorrect answers
	on "lm" fits with na.action = na.exclude (and perhaps other
	na.actions's except na.omit and na.fail).

    o	pmax() and pmin() sometimes used NAs in internal subassignments,
	and sometimes these failed.

    o	Subassigning an expression, e.g. expr[2] <- 1, could leave an
	invalid object and so cause a segfault. (PR#7326)

    o	download/install.packages() would misbehave if there was more
	than one version of a package in a repository.

    o	sort(partial=) silently ignored some other arguments: using
	'decreasing' or 'index.return' or supplying a factor are now
	errors.

    o   The ave() function had trouble if the grouping contained
	unused levels.

    o   read.fwf() got confused by skip > 0 and could infinite loop
	under some circumstances.  (PR#7350)

    o	upgrade(x, ask = FALSE) was broken for a "packageStatus" object.

    o   Class "raw" had been omitted from the list of basic classes in
	the "methods" package and so could not be used in S4 classes.

    o   Function getGroupMembers(), part of the definition of S4
	classes, had been promised for release 2.0, but slipped through.
