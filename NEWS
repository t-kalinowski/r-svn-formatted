		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	hessian argument added to deriv and its methods.  A new function
	deriv3 provides identical capabilities to deriv except that
	hessian is TRUE by default.

    o	New components in .Machine give the sizes of long, long long
	and long double C types (or 0 if they do not exist).

    o	postscript() allows user-specified encoding, with encoding
	files supplied for Windows, Mac, Unicode and various others,
	and with an appropriate platform-specific default.

    o	pdf() graphics driver.

    o	eigen() tests for symmetry with a numerical tolerance.

    o	file and pipe connections can be read with a user-specified
	encoding.

    o	New function checkFF() for checking foreign function calls.

    o	package.skeleton() helps with creating new packages.

    o	Generalised "birthday paradox" functions [pq]birthday.

    o	dist() can now handle missing values, and zeroes in the
	Canberra distance.

    o	New function difftime() and corresponding class for date/time 
	differences.

    o	Subtraction and logical comparison of objects from different
	date/time classes is now supported.  NB: the format for the
	difference of two objects of the same date/time class has
	changed, but only for objects generated by this version, not
	those generated by earlier ones.

    o	stl() has more optional arguments for fine tuning,
	a summary() and an improved plot() method.

    o	The four bessel[IJKY](x,nu) functions are now defined for nu < 0.

    o	New replacement functions substr<-() and substring<-().

    o	Under Unix, shlib modules for add-on packages are now linked
	against R as a shared library (`libR') if this exists.	(This
	allows for improved embedding of R into other applications.)

    o	coplot() has a new argument `bar.bg' (color of conditioning bars),
	gives nicer plots when the conditioners are factors, and allows
	factors for x and y (treated almost as if unclass()ed) using new
	argument `axlabels' {original ideas by Thomas Baummann}.

    o	read.fwf() has a new argument `n' for specifying the number of
	records (lines) read in.

    o   plot.mts() has a new argument `panel' providing the same
        functionality as in coplot().
	
    o   outer() has a speed-up in the default case of a matrix 
	outer product (by Jonathan Rougier).

    o	aperm() uses strides in the internal C code and so is substantially
	sped up (by Jonathan Rougier).


BUG FIXES

    o	Unused entry points in `src/appl/fortran.c' and `Fortran.h'
	have been removed.

    o	Unused directory src/f2clib and header src/include/R_ext/f2c.h
	have been removed.

    o	plot(1:2, xaxs = "i") now gives both "1.0" and "2.0" x-axis labels.

    o	qchisq(0.025, 31, ncp=1, lower.tail=FALSE) now works.  (PR#875)

    o	curve(*, add = TRUE) now works properly with active log scales.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.2.3


BUG FIXES

    o	`Writing R Extensions' incorrectly described an entry point
	`fmod' which was not included in the R binary on most systems.
	The entry point has been removed, to avoid any confusion with
	the standard C entry point of the same name.

    o	Printing of kernels in package ts was unreliable: the internal
	representation was correct.

    o	A problem with "..." in substitutions has been fixed (PR#860). 

    o	Various strangeness with match.call() and "..." has been fixed
	(PR#813).

    o   sys.function() could return an unevaluated promise, messing up
        formals() and match.arg() (PR#872)

    o	Deparsing or dumping attributes with non-standard names was
	not quoting the name (PR#871).

    o	We now use match.fun() in tapply() so that it won't get trapped
	by non-functions masking FUN.

    o	The `nmax' argument in scan(what=list(...), nmax=300) was
	counting blank lines, although they were said to be ignored.
	This affected using read.table on files with blank lines in
	1.2.2, and using `n' with `what' a list.

    o	as.numeric(), as.integer(), as.complex() returned zero on
	completely blank strings. Now they return NA. (PR#870)

    o	Overflow in deparse() in terms(formula) with very long left-hand
	side fixed (PR#873)

    o	lowess(c(1:3, 7:5)) now should give the same on different platforms,
	since now in the C code (int)(f*n + 1e-7) is used.

    o	rt() could give different results on different platforms as
	the order of evaluation of calls to random numbers was not
	fully defined.  This affected the Mac port.

    o	ppr() inside nested calls sometimes failed to find objects
	due to a typo in the eval call in ppr.formula.

    o	dchisq with integer x, df and ncp sometimes gave incorrect
	results on i686 Linux.

    o   cancelling a quit caused quit() not to ask next time it was called.

    o   some complicated operations with "..." didn't work.

    o   missingness was not correctly propagated in some cases.

    o	eigen() segfaulted on 0-dimensional matrices.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.2.2


NEW FEATURES

    o	The Macintosh port becomes a full member of the R family and its
	sources are incorporated as from this release.	
	See `src/macintosh/INSTALL' for how that port is built.

    o	The API header files and export files `R.exp' are released under
	LGPL rather than GPL to allow dynamically loaded code to be
	distributed under licences other than GPL.

    o	postscript() and xfig() devices now make use of genuine Adobe
	afm files, and warn if characters are used in string width or
	height calculations that are not in the afm files.

    o	Configure now uses a much expanded search list for finding a
	FORTRAN 77 compiler, and no longer disallows wrapper scripts for
	this compiler.

    o	New Rd markup \method{GENERIC}{CLASS} for indicating the usage
	of methods.

    o	print.ftable() and write.ftable() now have a `digits' argument.

    o	undoc() has a new `lib.loc' argument, and its first argument is
	now called `package'.


BUG FIXES

    o	The behaviour of polygon() with NA coordinate values is now
	documented.

    o	polygon() now correctly recycles the values of border and lty.
	Thanks to Denis White.

    o	readBin() and writeBin() were not always making good use of
	long types (such as long double) when available.

    o	The C function fprec was not handling very small denormalized
	numbers correctly.  This affected the way they were printed on
	Windows, for example.

    o	legend() now draws points after lines allowing "empty dots on
	lines" thanks to Ben Bolker.

    o	Setting row/column names preserves the names of the dimnames
	(PR#809). 

    o	Using help() after help.start() on Unix was failing to find
	the linked help files if more than one package was loaded (as
	now happens by default).

    o	scan now sets the maximal sizes internally when `what' is a list
	from `nmax' and failing that `nlines'.	This uses memory much
	more efficiently if `nmax' is specified.  read.table() makes use
	of this.

    o	The FORTRAN code used is now much closer to ANSI compliance.

    o	cov.rob() gives a useful error message on nearly-degenerate
	matrices.

    o	summary() on a data frame was computing results to a precision
	based on options("digits") (default 4), not its `digits'
	argument.  Now results are computed to full precision but 
	formatted using `digits'.

    o	summary(m, digits=*) also properly works for matrices.

    o	When returning parameters from .C/.Fortran, the OBJECT field was
	not copied even though class attributes were (PR#834).

    o	There was a spurious warning from the X11 driver on 100 dpi
	displays (PR#840, fix from Tom Vogels).

    o	scan() was reading all-blank numeric fields as zero. 
	Should be read as NA, and are now. 

    o	dnbinom(*, size, *) now works again for size < 1 (PR#842).

    o	dgeom(*, p = 0) and pgeom(*, p = 0) don't give NaN anymore.

    o	smooth.spline() allows zero weights again.

    o	aperm() fix for list arg; aperm(*, resize=FALSE) now works with
	dimnames (by dropping them).

    o	The xfig() driver was not closing unclosed polygons as the R
	driver expected (but did not document).

    o	spec.ar() now handles order 1 correctly.

    o	Add fuzz to prevent anomalies with hist().

    o	print.matrix() checks length of rowlab, collab (PR#850)

    o	add1.glm() was using the wrong weights for binomial glms in
	cbind(successes, failures) ~ lhs  form, since 1.2.0.

    o	Eliminate packing of the `structRstart' structure, which was
	probably non-ISO C and caused some compilers problems (PR#852).

    o	all.vars() no longer returns empty `names' (PR#829).

    o	dotplot() passes `cex' down to the mtext() calls used for the
	labels (PR#816).

    o	The pictex() driver was drawing polylines incorrectly (PR#845).

    o	In the event of a fatal X11 error (this can be generated under FVWM
	by selecting Destroy), the input handler would loop, leaving the
	"please save work and shut down R" advice useless. There should now
	be an opportunity for a relatively graceful exit.  

    o	polyroot() misbehaved if all coefficients except that of the highest
	degree term were zero (partial fix for PR#751)

    o	spline(method="natural") was extrapolating incorrectly (both
	to the left and to the right, for different reasons).  (PR#653)

    o	Line clipping was incorrect for log-plots. (PR#839)

    o	Add explicit test for rank-deficient residuals to summary.manova().

    o	The help search databases did not contain the data from the
	platform-specific help files.

    o	parse.dcf() and hence package.contents() now work with a warning
	for empty contents' files.

    o	which.min() and which.max() now properly work for 0-length and
	NA-only arguments.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.2.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	New functions factanal(), varimax(), promax() and examples in
	package mva.

    o	New functions readBin() and writeBin() to transfer binary data
	to and from connections.

    o	merge() is partially moved to C to reduce its memory usage.

    o	library(help = PKG) now displays the contents of the package's
	DESCRIPTION file in addition to its INDEX.

    o	Sd2Rd can handle S4-style documentation too: see `Writing R
	Extensions'.

    o	prompt() now also works with a character argument (useful for
	producing many *.Rd files in a loop).

    o	The Unix front-end shell script now ignores a value for R_HOME
	found in the environment.

    o	Connections functions such as file() now accept a description of
	length > 1, with a warning.

    o	All text-mode connections now accept input with LF, CR or CRLF
	line endings.  This means that readLines() can be used on DOS
	files and source() on Mac files, for example.

	Also, CRLF-terminated files can be used as stdin on Unix, and
	files with last lines without an EOL mark can be used as stdin
	and source()-ed on Unix and Windows.

    o	DESCRIPTION file has a new recommended `Maintainer:' field.

    o	stars() now uses a larger "cex" for the labels, and cex and lwd
	are now arguments. Further, the argument names (xlim, ylim,
	axes) are now consistent with other plot functions.  The key symbol
	is not clipped anymore into the plot region by default.

    o	Date-time quantities are now printed with the timezone, if known.

    o	R CMD build now ignores all files specified (via Perl regexps)
	in file `.Rbuildignore' in the top-level source	directory of a
	package.

    o	Horizontal boxplots are possible with  horizontal = TRUE.

    o	all.equal() on lists now compares them as generic vectors, that
	is they are equal if have identical names attributes and
	all components are equal.

    o	Invalid lines in .Renviron now give warnings when R is started.

    o	Argument `na.last' implemented for rank().


BUG FIXES

    o	There have been many small improvements/corrections in the
	documentation. In particular:

	The help pages for lm and glm now describe the fitted objects.

	is.vector() is now correctly documented: complex vectors and
	lists return TRUE.

    o	The default sortedXyData constructor in the nls package now
	handles missing values in the response.

    o	On startup, file .RData is now restored *after* the site and
	user profiles are loaded (if at all).  This is as previously
	documented.

    o	as.POSIXlt (and *ct) operating on a character string
	only extracted the date (and not the time) in some cases.

    o	as.POSIXct() on character objects was ignoring `tz'.

    o	codoc(ignore.generic.functions = TRUE) works again.

    o	Explicitly close files opened by sink() for OSes (such as
	Windows) that benefit from it.

    o	Prevent closing the sink connection (which would be a silly
	thing to do).

    o	showConnections(all = TRUE) was sometimes counting connections
	incorrectly, and so not showing some closed ones.

    o	ts(1:10, start= c(1999,6), end = c(2000,3), frequency = 12)
	now prints both years (as it should).

    o	Monthly multivariate time series now print proper month names
	in all cases.

    o	print.stl(), print.princomp() and print.prcomp() now pass on
	`digits =' etc.

    o	prompt() now produces a \usage{} line for data frames and
	other datasets, as documented in `Writing R Extensions'.

    o	glm() now returns correct linear predictor and fitted values
	for zero-weight cases.

    o	scan(strip.white=TRUE) and readline() could give incorrect
	answers when an input field was empty or blank.

    o	dchisq() now behaves better for large values of its ncp parameter.

    o	besselJ(*, nu) is now ok for nu < 1; fix improves accuracy of
	other values by a few bits as well.

    o	The convergence criterion in the Fortran SVD code has been
	changed to circumvent spurious convergence errors when
	comparing extended-precision quantities on ix86 Linux (and
	some compilers and options).

    o	Rdindex now handles multi-line \title{}'s correctly.

    o	Add weights.glm() so that plot.lm() gets the correct weights from
	glm objects (the ones that go with deviance residuals not the
	working residuals).

    o	Printing a language object (e.g. a formula) in a list was
	clobbering the buffer holding the tag labels which then were
	lost in subsequent lines of printout (PR#746).

    o	aic in family() objects is now computed more precisely using
	dxxxx(log=TRUE).  For binomial fits the value was wrong for
	models specified via proportions and weights (PR#796).

	Avoid NaN values in aic where n = 0 occurs.

    o	Using non-integer numbers of successes in a binomial glm (as
	formerly in demo(lm.glm)) now gives a warning, as the theory and
	in particular the AIC value is not applicable.

    o	demo(is.things) works again {is.ALL() doesn't call methods
	anymore}.

    o	persp(*, nticks = nn) now works (better) for too small nn.
	persp(*, main = t1, sub= t2) now work (as always documented).

    o	Printing of attributes of a list element no longer precedes
	`attr' by the tag (PR#715).

    o	It is no longer possible to use df[foo] to select non-existent
	columns in df and so create an invalid object of class
	"data.frame" (PR#698).

    o	edit.data.frame() was trying to set row.names on a list, which
	is no longer allowed.

    o	In the \link[pkg]{topic}, `pkg' was not being used if `topic'
	was found in a package in .lib.loc.  Now `pkg' is always used.

    o	plot() with small relative ranges gave an error, which e.g. broke
	library(ts); plot(stl(ts(rep(1:7, 15), freq = 7), s.win = "per"))

    o	Using scan() with a 0-length `what' argument now gives an error
	message rather than a segfault.

    o	Loading .Random.seed could extremely rarely and with some
	generators reject a value as NA_INTEGER when it was valid.

    o	save(..., ascii=TRUE) created broken files when saving strings
	containing special characters (ASCII code > 127).

    o	mean(c(1,NA,NA,NA)[-1], trim = .1, na.rm = TRUE) doesn't give an
	error anymore.

    o	As the supplied afm files are not properly in the ISOLatin1
	encoding, the font metric for "-" was wrong since 0.63 on a
	postscript/xfig device, and randomly wrong in 1.2.0.  It will
	now be correct (but the files remain incorrect: C45 is "minus"
	not "hyphen" and there are missing slots).

	Metrics for the duplicated characters (acute, dieresis,
	macron, space) in ISOLatin1 encoding are now correct for both
	occurrences: previously only one was present.

    o	The data-time functions try harder to guess the DST setting
	when the OS does not know, as some OSes were printing times
	in DST if this was marked as unknown.

    o	Setting par(pty=) after par(pin=) or par(plt=) was having no
	effect until the margins were set.

    o	Nested \describe sections in .Rd files have (again) nested
	indentation when converted to text.

    o	Concatenation of C strings by ## is no longer used, to avoid
	spurious warnings from some recent versions of gcc.

    o	dev.copy2eps() allows a `paper' argument to be passed to
	postscript().

    o	file.show() handles the case of zero files better.

    o	formula.lm uses object$formula if it exists, in preference 
	to object$terms.

    o	strsplit() is corrected for an empty split pattern.

    o	kronecker() now does a better job when creating dimnames.

    o	Better handling of input dimnames in fourfoldplot().



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.2.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	There is a new memory management system using a generational
	garbage collector.  This improves performance, sometimes
	marginally but sometimes by double or more.  The workspace is
	no longer statically sized and both the vector heap and the
	number of nodes can grow as needed.  (They can shrink again,
	but never below the initially allocated sizes.)	 See ?Memory
	for a longer description, including the new command-line
	options to manage the settings.

    o	values of `--min-nsize' up to 50M (2Gb on 64-bit Solaris) are
	allowed.

    o	A (preliminary) version of S4-like connections has been added,
	and most functions which take a "file" argument can now work
	with a connection as well as a file name.  For more details,
	see the chapter on Connections in the R Data Import/Export
	manual.

    o	New command-line option `--no-restore-history' implied by
	`--vanilla'.

    o	Command-line option `--no-restore' is now `--no-restore-data'
	and `--no-restore' implies `--no-restore-*' (currently `data'
	and `history').

    o	The more recent GNU regex from grep-2.4.2 is used.  This uses
	locale-based ordering for ranges on platforms with strcoll.

    o	The print routines now escape " (as \") in a character string
	only when it is printed as a quoted string.  This makes
	print(, quote=FALSE) and cat() consistent.


    o	The standard methods for add1() and drop1() now attempt to cope
	with missing values by using a subset of the data that is
	`cleaned' by na.action for the maximal model under consideration.

    o	anova() for 3 or more lm objects now behaves compatibly	with S
	and anova.glmlist().  The old behaviour is still available by
	calling anovalist.lm() directly.

    o	anova() for multiple lm and glm objects no longer truncates the
	formula printed. There is much more extensive documentation
	for anova() methods.

    o	New method as.data.frame.table() for converting the array-based
	representation of a contingency table to a data frame containing
	the classifying factors and the corresponding counts.

    o	New function assocplot() for producing Cohen-Friendly
	association plots.

    o	autoload() accepts lib.loc and other arguments to library()

    o	bxp() has new argument `frame.plot', as plot.default().

    o	contour() now has `axes' and `frame.plot' args.

    o	contrasts(, FALSE) now always returns an identity matrix,
	to make model.matrix compatible with S. This affects models
	such as lm(y ~ o - 1) where o is an ordered factor.

    o	`where' command added to debug().

    o	demo(dynload) (which used the superseded call_R interface)
	has been removed.

    o	Class "dendrogram" in package mva providing general support
	for tree-like structures (plotting, cutting, ...).

    o	dev.copy2eps() and dev2bitmap() preserve the aspect ratio of the
	copied device if just one of `width' and `height' is specified.

    o	dump() has new argument append, argument `fileout' has been
	renamed to `file' (for consistency with all other functions).

    o	edit.default() now checks for an unset `editor' argument, and
	terminates with an error if the editor cannot be run.

    o	The `mode' argument of exists() and get() is interpreted
	as mode(x) rather than typeof(x), following S.

    o	New functions file.access() and file.info() for information on
	files on the user's file systems.

    o	New convenience function file.copy().

    o	file.show() allows `pager' argument to be an R function, and
	consequently, the `pager' option can be an R function.

    o	Formatting (and printing) of data.frames with complex objects is
	improved.  toString was added as a new function.

    o	format() has a new argument `justify' controlling the
	justification of character strings (and factors).

    o	Formula objects now have an environment and code manipulating
	them needs to take care to preserve it or set an appropriate
	environment.

    o	New function fourfoldplot() for producing fourfold displays of
	2 by 2 by k contingency tables.

    o	gc() now reports the space allocated, not the space free,
	since the total space is now variable.

    o	New primitive gc.time() to report on time spent in garbage
	collection.

    o	hclust() takes new argument `members' allowing dissimilarity
	matrices both for singletons (as until now) and clusters.

    o	help() has an additional `pager' argument which may be passed to
	file.show()  {useful for ESS fans}.

    o	There is now an R `Hershey' list object for Hershey vector font
	computations and documentation.

    o	hist() now returns a "histogram" object and calls the new
	function plot.histogram() for plotting.
	It now also allows character labels.

    o	if(*) now gives a more intelligible error message
	when "*" cannot be coerced to logical.

    o	inherits() is now an internal function and compatible with S.

    o	New function lag.plot() in package ts.

    o	legend() has a new argument pt.bg.

    o	The commands history can be loaded with loadhistory(), saved
	with savehistory() and displayed with history(), under Windows
	and under Unix using the readline or GNOME interfaces.

    o	mad() has new (logical) arguments "low" and "high" (the first
	giving S compatibility).

    o	New function manova() and summary method.

    o	Function mantelhaen.test() in package ctest now can deal with
	general I x J x K tables.  In addition, in the 2 x 2 x K case,
	it can also perform an exact conditional test of independence,
	and gives confidence intervals for the common odds ratio.

    o	model.frame() now uses the environment of its formula argument,
	rather than the parent environment, to evaluate variables not
	found in the data argument. See help(formula).

    o	mosaicplot() can now also create extended mosaic plots, which
	visualize the residuals from a log-linear model using color and
	outline.

    o	New utility function n2mfrow().

    o	nlm(check.analyticals = TRUE) now warns if the supplied
	gradient and/or hessian are of the wrong length.

    o	New function object.size() to give approximate memory allocation.

    o	optim() now checks the length of an analytical gradient at
	each evaluation.

    o	The L-BFGS-B method of optim() now support tracing, at several
	levels of detail.

     o	options(check.bounds = TRUE)  makes each vector extension
	by sub-assignment ("x[.] <- .") produce a warning.

   o	options(width) now admits to a limit (previously 200, now
	10000) and gives a more informative message if out of range
	(as it does now for digits and expressions).

    o	Function path.expand() to do tilde-expansion on file paths.
	This provides an interface to R_ExpandFileName, which is now
	a documented entry point.

    o	.Platform has new component "endian", useful for binary file
	manipulations.

    o	plot.function() and curve() now take xlim as default for (from,to)
	if the former is specified.

    o	plot.hclust() allows arguments main, sub, etc, and has non-empty
	defaults for these.

    o	plot.ts(x,y) now allows to suppress labels and lines;
	it is better documented.

    o	The postscript() driver now allows a user-specified family so,
	for example, one can use the same fonts in diagrams as in
	running text.

    o	The postscript() driver allows its prolog to be changed (by an
	expert) via object .ps.prolog.

    o	prop.table() and margin.table() now work with an empty `margin'.

    o	Formerly deprecated function provide() is now defunct.

    o	New functions read.delim() and read.delim2() to make it
	easier to read delimited files as Windows programs tend to
	create (usually TAB separated).

    o	New readLines() function to read a file line-by-line.

    o	New functions reshapeLong() and reshapeWide() emulating Stata's
	reshape command. These are still labeled experimental and
	might be improved (or removed) in later versions.

    o	row.names() and row.names<-() are now generic functions which
	call rownames() as their default method and have methods for
	class "data.frame".

    o	New function Rprof() for profiling R expressions under Unix.
	Configure with `--enable-R-profiling' (on by default) to make
	this operational.

    o	save(, oldstyle=TRUE) has been withdrawn.

    o	scan() and read.table() have a new argument `fill' which can
	be set TRUE to allow reading files with unequal number of
	fields per line. (Programs like Excel have a habit of creating
	such files when exporting.)

    o	scan() and read.table() have a new argument `blank.lines.skip'
	to allow blank lines to be read.

    o	scan() now reads empty character fields as "" not "NA" unless
	"" is included in na.strings.

    o	smooth() in package eda has a better default (3RS3R instead of
	3RSR) and more arguments, e.g. `twiceit' for some S
	compatibility and `kind = "3R"' for running medians of 3.

    o	strsplit() has a new argument `extended' controlling whether to
	use extended (the default) or basic regular expressions for
	splitting.

    o	Sys.getenv() becomes the preferred name for getenv(), which is
	now deprecated.

    o	New functions Sys.getlocale() and Sys.setlocale() to query and
	set aspects of the locale of the R process, and
	Sys.localeconv() to find the default decimal point, etc.

    o	New function Sys.info() for platform, host and user information.

    o	New function Sys.putenv() to set environment variables.

    o	New function Sys.sleep() to suspend execution for a while.

    o	Date-time support functions with classes "POSIXct" and
	"POSIXlt" to represent dates/times (resolution 1 second) in
	the POSIX formats.  Functions include Sys.time(), as.POSIXct(),
	strftime(), strptime(),	 and methods for format, plot, c, ....
	There are conversion functions for objects from packages
	`date' and `chron'; unlike those packages these support
	functions know about time zones (if the OS does).

    o	tcltk package now has tkpager() which is designed to be used
	by file.show() and shows help pages etc. in separate text
	widgets.

    o	tcltk is now more careful about removing the objects
	representing widgets in the R workspace when the windows are
	destroyed (e.g. using window manager controls)

    o	tcltk package has had several canvas functions implemented.

    o	tcltk now wraps callbacks to R in a try() construct - the
	nonlocal return from R's error handling could bring the Tk
	system into a strange state.

    o	New demos for tcltk: tkfaq, tkfilefind, tkcanvas.

    o	termplot() now has an `ask' argument.

    o	terms() creates objects which now inherit from class "formula",
	so for example as.formula(terms.object) needs to be replaced by
	formula(terms.object).

    o	traceback() is now printed un-quoted and labelled by the
	frame number.

    o	New argument `recursive' to unlink(). The default behaviour on
	Unix is now that of rm -f, not rm -rf.	unlink() is now
	compatible across platforms.

    o	New functions write.ftable() and read.ftable() for writing out
	and reading in flat contingency tables.

    o	write.table() now quotes factor columns if quote=TRUE, and has
	a new argument `qmethod' to control the escaping of
	embedded quotes in character or factor columns.

    o	New function xtabs() providing a formula interface to cross
	tabulation.


    o	The R Data Import/Export Manual (`R-data.texi') has been added.

    o	The set of valid R names is now described (at last) in R-intro.

    o	The R Language Manual (`R-lang.texi') is now included and built
	in the same way as the other manuals.

    o	The R manuals (R-intro, R-exts, ...) are converted to HTML
	format (if the necessary texinfo tools are available) and
	linked into the top HTML help page.

    o	The header file `R.h' and those included from it are now usable
	with C++ code.

    o	New header file `R_ext/Boolean.h': Rboolean type with TRUE and
	FALSE enum constants.

    o	New header file `Rgraphics.h' to allow addons to use graphics
	structures.

    o	Recommended include file `Rmath.h' replaces `R_ext/Mathlib.h'.

    o	Bessel, beta and gamma functions are now documented as part of
	the API.  Undocumented entry points are no longer in the
	header files, and some are no longer visible.

    o	Calloc & Realloc failures now give size information.

    o	DESCRIPTION file in installed packages has a new `Built:' field
	giving build information (R version, platform, date).

    o	Much improved support for C++ code in add-on packages under Unix.
	New configure/build variables SHLIB_CXXLD and SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS
	for specifying the command and flags needed for building shared
	libraries containing objects from a C++ compiler.
	Configure tries to get these right in typical cases (GNU tools
	and/or common platforms).
	C++ source suffixes `.cpp' and `.C' are now recognized in
	addition to `.cc'.

    o	Configure/build variables MAINLD and MAINLDFLAGS are renamed to
	MAIN_LD and MAIN_LDFLAGS for consistency with other MAIN_* vars,
	similarly for SHLIBLD and SHLIBLDFLAGS.

    o	Configure/build variable FLIBS now only contains the Fortran 77
	intrinsic and run-time libraries needed for linking a Fortran 77
	program or shared library (as determined by configure).	 BLAS
	library detection was extended, with results saved to the Make
	variable BLAS_LIBS which is also available to add-on packages.

    o	R CMD build and check have been completely re-written in Perl.
	In addition to running examples, check now also checks the
	directory structure and control files, makes a temporary
	installation and runs LaTeX on the help pages.	Build has been
	reduced to cleaning, rewriting indices and creating tar files.

	The same files of Perl code are now also used under Windows.

    o	Add-ons for utilities like Perl or LaTeX have now a central
	place in $R_HOME/share. Migration of existing files might take
	a while, though.

    o	Preliminary support for building R as a shared library (`libR')
	under Unix.  Use configure with option `--enable-R-shlib' or do
	`make libR' in directory `src/main' to create the shared
	library.

	There is also a linker front-end `R CMD LINK' which is useful
	for creating executable programs linked against the R shared
	library.


BUG FIXES

    o	New "[.AsIs" function fixing PR#665.

    o	Effectively zero-length arrows() are omitted (rather than getting
	a system- and device-dependent arbitrary angle).

    o	barplot() passes "..." down to plot.window as documented.

    o	bxp(*) now obeys axes, xaxt, yaxt & ylim arguments (again?).

    o	contour(.., labcex = 0.6, .. , vfont = c("sans serif", "plain"), ..)
	now behaves as it has been documented, PR#740.

    o	D(.) is now more correctly documented, has second argument
	"name" instead of "namevec" (S compatibility), and gives a warning
	when name has not length 1.

    o	dbinom() and dpois() now use a the accurate algorithm of C.Loader;
	e.g., 1 - 2*sum(dbinom(0:999, 1999, 1/2)) is now zero instead of 1e-12.

    o	dbeta(), df(), dt(), dnbinom(), dgeom(), dgamma(),
	now all use the more accurate algorithms of dbinom() and dpois();
	More limits are computed correctly, e.g. dgeom(Inf,*), or
	dnbinom(*,*,p=0), and integer argument coercion is more consistent.

    o	dbeta(x, a,b) was giving NaN and Inf for large a and b.

    o	The math functions now (again!) return NaN (not NA)
	when the warning message says so (e.g. gamma(-1)).

    o	Paper sizes for "a4" and "legal" were interchanged in dev.print().

    o	Improved logic in the re-scaling of plots in dev.print().

    o	dev.print() and dev.copy2eps() now evaluate arguments as
	needed, so e.g. dev.print(file="junk.ps", horizontal=F) will
	work (previously =FALSE was needed).

    o	Now dweibull(0,1) == dexp(0) == 1 for consistency.

    o	Changing column modes from factor/character to numeric in
	edit.data.frame() (and fix() on data frames) is now allowed.

    o	gctorture() did return a value although documented not to, that of
	gcinfo.	 It now returns the previous setting of gctorture.

    o	glm() now follows lm() in dropping unused factor levels when fitting.

    o	hist() now labels y-axis Density rather than Relative Frequency
	if freq=FALSE. The `intensities' component of the result is
	now deprecated and `density' should be used instead.

    o	hsv() truncation bug fixed (hopefully correctly this time...)

    o	library.dynam() no longer fails if the library appears more than
	once in lib.loc.

    o	lm.fit & lm.wfit (and hence lm) now give understandable error
	messages when there are 0 non-NA cases.

    o	match() does not always use "as.character()" anymore, fixes PR#741.

    o	Trimmed mean() and median() are no longer attempted for complex
	data.

    o	median() of empty vector is now NA.

    o	model.matrix() can now handle NAs in factors.

    o	model.matrix() now uses ":" not "." in labelling interaction
	terms, as terms() and the prototype do (PR#701).

    o	old.packages() now sorts version strings correctly by
	splitting at "." and "-".

    o	optim() has several new precautions against bugs, one of which was
	an infinite loop in the L-BFGS-B method if the derivatives
	were inaccurate (or if numerical derivatives were used and the
	problem was badly scaled).

    o	pairs() now obeys an "cex = " argument, and so does panel.smooth().

    o	pf() had a bug in the code handling large noncentrality
	parameters, going all the way back to the original Appl.Stat.
	algorithm (PR#752). This affected pbeta() as well.

    o	phantom(expr) in plotmath was used to calculate the bounding
	boxes, but the space was not actually used in typesetting the
	expression (PR#622).

    o	Problem with subsetting and "..." arguments in plot.formula()
	(PR#757)

    o	plot.lm() has a better default for its `ask' argument.

    o	plot.new() does *NOT* allow an argument (`ask') anymore.
	This has not been working (since ~ R 0.49), is low-level and
	hence should not break anything.

    o	plot.stl() now uses correct time labels for tickmarks of x-axes.

    o	pnorm() is somewhat more accurate (SIXTEN=16; PR#699) and
	`infinitesimally faster' in some cases, thanks to James M. Rath.

    o	Failure to open a postscript() device now gives diagnostic warnings.

    o	Zero the widths of undefined chars in postscript().

    o	Make font metrics local to the device in postscript(), so
	that simultaneous instances of postscript/xfig/bitmap can use
	different values for `family'.

    o	postscript() no longer uses the initclip operator, which
	was against the EPSF specifications and broke inclusion of
	graphics in some documents.

    o	In postscript(), cleaned up the internals to fix some
	cases where it was unclear whether a variable was meant to set
	or track device status.

    o	In some cases, emitted postscript violated the PS Document
	Structuring Conventions since some settings were carried over from
	one page to the next. (Caused breakage when turning
	antialiasing on/off in "gv" for instance.)

    o	The DocumentMedia comment in postscript() output was wrong,
	and the font DSC comments have been changed to the preferred
	style for DSC 3.0.

    o	pretty(x <- c(2.8,3))[1] - x[1] is now 0; in general,
	p <- pretty(x) now again fulfills  p[1] <= x[] <= p[length(p)].

    o	print.dist() {mva} now passes "..." to print.default.

    o	print.noquote("ABC") now works.

    o	prompt(fn) uses fn's "source" attribute if it has one.

    o	In prop.test(), the conf.int. now contains the estimate,
	even when that is 0 or 1 (PR#714).

    o	qnorm(0) and qnorm(1) now give -/+ Inf (again!).

    o	qt(*, log = TRUE) has a somewhat extended working range.

    o	Specifying col.names in read.table() now overrides any header
	line in the data file.

    o	Bug caused rpois() to generate biased variables in some cases.

    o	scale(scale=TRUE) gave all NAs in any columns containing NAs.

    o	eda's smooth() now computes Tukey's endrule properly.

    o	smooth.spline()'s GCV method now uses a more accurate formula
	when there are repeated x points.

    o	stars() fix (for 0/NA columns) PR#739.

    o	data(state)'s  state.abb  has been corrected to use official
	2-letter abbrevations.

    o	strsplit() had two memory leaks.

    o	tcltk interface now has better string quoting and no longer breaks on
	strings with unbalanced braces

    o	tcltk callbacks used to include a "%..." argument on the call if the
	callback function had a "..." argument. This is no longer the case.

    o	t.test() allows an input vector of length 2.

    o	Method dispatch in primitive functions such as `c' only
	occurred if they were called by that name, and in particular
	not if used in lapply or called as .Primitive("c").  It now
	always occurs.

    o	Method dispatching now forces evaluation of promises, so
	autoloading works with methods.

    o	c(0.099999994, 0.2) prints as 0.1 0.2 not 0.10 0.20 after
	correcting the precision calculations.

    o	Internal function fprec was overflowing for numbers around
	1e-305.

    o	[internal] .C("strsignif",*) doesn't use fixed size strings anymore
	(possible overflow).

    o	ff[i] <- r  now works for formula (and potentially other
	non-standard) objects ff.

    o	Errors in argument matching could cause crashes if error
	handler was used.

    o	NULL == ... now gives logical(0) instead of an error.
	This fixes a bug with e.g. apply(X,2,median, na.rm = TRUE) and
	all(NULL == NULL) is now TRUE.

    o	polylines with more than 64K pieces will now work on more X
	servers with the x11 device.

    o	R CMD Rd2dvi now again works with file names containing "_" or "$".

    o	R CMD Rdconv now handles .rd as input file extension correctly
	in all cases.

    o	make install could fail if there were no shared libraries to
	install (e.g. on vanilla Solaris).

    o	Rd's \describe{} constructs are converted better to text
	output, and \items of >=22 chars now work.

    o	Help aliases "(" and "{" now work, apart from as PDF hyperlinks.

    o	NA || x , NA && y (etc) do not give errors anymore, but work as
	the "|" and "&" operators and as documented (PR#749).

    o	Coercing lists to functions failed if argument list was empty.
	(PR#743). Also coercing functions to lists was wrong when the
	body was a single constant.

	**************************************************


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.1.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	data(), example() and help() now search the loaded packages, then
	in their .lib.loc argument, the latter as pre-0.99.0.  See
	their help pages for the precise details.

    o	help() has a new argument `try.all.packages' set by the option
	"help.try.all.packages". If help is not found in the normal
	path and this is TRUE then a search is made of all packages
	for possible matches.

    o	Improved detection of Tcl/Tk at configure time.	 One can either
	set configure variables TCLTK_CPPFLAGS and TCLTK_LIBS, or give
	the locations of the tclConfig.sh and tkConfig.sh scripts via
	the `--with-tcl-config' and `--with-tk-config' arguments.

    o	prop.trend.test() - test for trend in proportions.

    o	write.table() has new argument `dec' for setting the decimal
	separator (SPSS/Windows and probably others want commas in
	continental European locales).

    o	Advance warning: save(, oldstyle=TRUE) will no longer be
	available after this release.

    o	Symbols can now be coerced to expressions, making
	as.expression(quote(a)) work


BUG FIXES

    o	data() now works correctly with data-only packages.

    o	Standalone Mathlib can now be made if builddir = srcdir
	(working around an undocumented autoconf `feature').

    o	Check for pre-1.1.0 saved object .Postscript.options in postscript().

    o	More stringent checks on the arguments to dataentry().

    o	Specifying xlab as an expression now works again.

    o	dev2bitmap() works again.

    o	Numerous uses of `F' and `T' replaced by `FALSE' and `TRUE'.

    o	bxp() now extends `ylim' properly when notch=TRUE (and a
	notch is more extreme than other stats).
	Also, varwidth is okay again, see example(split).

    o	Making manuals without making R first now works.

    o	princomp() now works when some eigenvalues are tiny negative
	values (which are treated as zero).

    o	SearchEngine.html was not installed when builddir != srcdir.

    o	lm.{w}fit(x,y,..) now work when x has no column names.
	These functions no longer add and subtract n zeros when there's no
	offset.	 They are now documented somewhat.

    o	Some HTML files used src="R.css" instead of href="R.css" causing
	some browsers to ignore the style sheet.  `R.css' now passes the
	w3c CSS validator and gives the intended results with Internet
	Explorer.  `R.css' is copied to all library directories.

    o	The data editor no longer crashes when entries contain more than
	45 characters, and works correctly if the field width is
	larger than the window width.

    o	Recording plots used to ignore graphics events before the last
	replay.

    o	plot(), points(), etc now give warnings and error for invalid
	`type' arguments.

    o	matplot() now allows the same `type's as plot().

    o	dev.print() and dev.copy2eps() now work when called from a
	function, such as dev2bitmap().

    o	anova.glmlist works correctly with decreasing models and
	test="F" now gets the correct residual df.

    o	Functions created (not just edited) with fix() now get
	environment .GlobalEnv not the body of fix.

    o	Rdconv was ignoring OS-specific parts of the files with some
	Perl versions. (This did not affect installing packages.)

    o	R CMD check  did not run more than one specific test.

    o	keyword2html omitted items when changing up a level, so
	the HTML search engine keyword list was missing `data' and
	`utilities', for example.

    o	aov() with multiple strata was setting some spurious options.

    o	Under UNIX, help(, htmlhelp=TRUE) uses the linked copy of the
	HTML file in ~/.R if help.start() has been run recently in the
	session, so the style sheet and hyperlinks should now be found.

    o	dotplot's arguments `color' and `lcolor' are now interpreted
	correctly if they are vectors of length > 1.  (It is not clear
	from the help that this was ever intended.)

    o	Error messages of e.g. do.call() are now spaced properly.

    o	summary(.matrix | .data.frame) now respects a `digits' argument.

    o	scan() recognises quoted strings by default again. The default
	for the quote= argument got set wrongly when it was
	introduced. They are, however, turned off when using sep="\n",
	since you probably want unprocessed lines of text in that
	case.

    o	fixed buglet where scan() would double a character following a
	terminating quote symbol.

    o	kmeans was failing on vector inputs (although not documented
	to accept such).

    o	fixes in predict.lm (John Maindonald)

    o	NCOL got confused by 1D arrays, which it now reports have 1
	column rather than NA.

    o	rep(1:2,c(1,-1)) segfaulted (PR 619)

    o	x[["a"]] <- y rejected some object types for y (e.g.
	expressions) which were accepted in x$a <- y (PR

    o	data editor froze on empty data frame, and more generally on
	zero-length cols.

    o	data editor did not handle factors properly in numeric-edit
	mode.

    o	table() misbehaved on empty (or all-NA) data

    o	data editor now handles empty data frames, allowing data entry
	to begin with  dd<-edit(data.frame())  or
	dd<-data.frame() ; fix(dd)

    o	plotting math expressions when specified as a LANGSXP or
	SYMSXP didn't work in several cases: plot(1,main=quote(a))
	would segfault and there were problems with title(), text(),
	and mtext() as well.

    o	optim(): no more segfault for REPORT=0; corrected error msg; ..
	maxit default is now okay also when "L-*-B" is chosen automatically.
	Using (abs|rel)tol with that method now gives a warning.

    o	text() did not respect its `xpd' argument, the default of which
	is still to use par("xpd"); gave a wrong error message in one case.

    o	polygon() had an incorrect documentation and silently disregarded
	"..." arguments.

    o	predict.loess was giving incorrect results (those for the
	non-robust fit) in the case of a fit with family = "symmetric"
	and surface = "direct" and prediction with se = FALSE.	The
	fitted values were missing for such fits.

    o	Better rendering of ^ and ~ in latex in \code{} (and they should
	not appear outside code and verbatim sections).

    o	Fixed unterminated string problem with lty (PR 584)

    o	Fixed scoping problem with quasi() family (PR 614)


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.1.0


NEW FEATURES


    o	There are several changes to the compile and link flags, and
	an attempt is made to use /usr/local/include and
	/usr/local/lib on all platforms.  Please read config.site and
	INSTALL if you have set flags for previous versions.

    o	New package tcltk, providing interface and language bindings for
	the Tcl/Tk graphical interface toolkit. This makes it possible
	to do some rather nifty things with buttons and entry fields
	and so forth in very few lines of code.	 It is still somewhat
	experimental so don't go churning out thousands of lines of
	GUI code and then blame us for changing the API later on. It does
	not currently work with GNOME because of event loop differences.
	See demo(tkttest) and demo(tkdensity).

    o	Internally using global R_Expressions [getOption("expressions")]
	dramatically speeds up eval.c.

    o	The X11 support code is now in a separate shared library, and
	option `--gui=none' will run R without X11 support (and so x11()
	and data.entry() will not be available).  R BATCH sets --gui=none.

    o	Configuring without X (e.g., `--without-x') does work (at last).
	configure will report if X11 support has been included.
	If R has been built without X11 the default GUI is "none".

    o	GNOME support files have moved from src/gnome to src/unix/gnome
	and the code is now in a separate shared library.  Both
	`--gui=GNOME' and `--gui=gnome' are allowed.

	The main graphics device for use with GNOME is now called
	gtk(); the x11() device from the X11 support can also be used.
	(The gnome() device remains unreliable, and is by default
	unavailable.)

	All GNOME support now installs in R_HOME/gnome to make it
	easier to package separately.

    o	Command line option `-g' can now be used as short version of
	`--gui'.

    o	The "keep.source" option now defaults to interactive()
	instead of TRUE.

    o	Many interface enhancements to the data editor, which now uses
	(by default) variable-width columns and much less redrawing.
	See ?dataentry for a description of the current user interface.

    o	R under Unix can be sent SIGUSR1 to quit and save or SIGUSR2
	to quit and save without running .Last and on.exit
	expressions.

    o	Added ability to use the graphics device driver to perform
	horizontal justification of strings.  This is used in the
	x11(), windows(), postscript() and xfig() drivers and will
	lead to more accurate placing of centred or right-justified
	strings.

    o	Formulas created with the tilde operator now contain the
	environment in which they were created.	 The environment of a
	formula can be accessed with the environment() function.  This
	facility is still experimental; it is intended to help
	simplify writing modeling functions.


    o	$ and $<- are now generic functions.

    o	add1.glm() and drop1.glm() now allow test="F", which is
	appropriate for models with estimated dispersion.

    o	approx() and approxfun() have an extra argument ties= to control
	handling of tied x values

    o	New function as.symbol(), identical to as.name().
	is.symbol and is.name() are now identical by definition;
	before, they were equivalent by implementation.

    o	attach() now works for R data files.

    o	axis() now has additional arguments.  The argument "tick" turns
	tick drawing on and off (on by default).  Additional arguments
	line, pos, and outer; allow more flexible placement of axes.

    o	New device bitmap(), like dev2bitmap() but a stand-alone device.

    o	boxplot() returns (and bxp() accepts) a list containing the summary
	statistics for the boxes (changed from a list of elements one for
	each box).

    o	file="|cmd" is allowed (to pipe output to `cmd'), under cat()
	and postscript() and functions that use them (for example, write()).

    o	New functions chartr() for general-purpose character translation
	in character vectors, and tolower() and toupper() for converting
	alphabetic characters to lower-case and upper-case, respectively.

    o	coplot() has new option subscripts=TRUE to pass the indices
	to the panel function.

    o	cor.test(method="spearman") might give slightly better P values,
	since it now relies on pnorm() (with proper tail) instead of alnorm.

    o	dbinom() works for size=0 (where appropriate).

    o	New trivial function det() for determinant computation
	(the example in ?qr did not seem to be sufficient).

    o	If present in the package, a function .Last.lib will be called
	when a package is detached.

    o	New function dev.copy2eps() copies the current device to an eps
	file, taking the size from that of the device.

    o	dev.print() now prints if possible, and takes the size from
	the device being copied.

    o	edit() or fix() applied to a numeric or character matrix now
	uses the data editor, if available.

    o	edit.data.frame() edits factors in character mode by default,
	and will allow the row names to be edited, by default if they
	are not 1:nrow(name).

    o	expand.model.frame() for adding variables to a model frame.

    o	The handling of estimating the dispersion in glm() fits has been
	changed for consistency across methods.	 For `binomial' and
	`poisson' families the dispersion is always taken as one.
	For `quasibinomial' and `quasipoisson' families it is always
	estimated (by residual chisq/residual df).

    o	Using "~" when specifying lib.loc (for example to help() or
	library()) is now supported.

    o	image() has a new argument "breaks" and divides the zlim range
	into equal-length intervals.

    o	install.packages() and update.packages() have a new `destdir'
	argument for the directory to which to download the packages.

    o	New function interaction.plot().

    o	Internal cleanup of lapply()'s C code.

    o	library(), require(), and sys.source() have a new argument
	` keep.source = getOption("keep.source.pkgs") '.
	This defaults to false, but can be set (also for base) to true
	by setting the environment variable R_KEEP_PKG_SOURCE to "yes"

    o	Par `lty' in lines() now defaults to par("lty") not "solid",
	for consistency with plot().

    o	list.files() [aka dir()]: path argument has now default = "."

    o	locator() allows inline graphics parameters (for the plotting
	it does with type !="n").

    o	New function max.col() from MASS, thanks to V&R.

    o	nlm() can now take additional arguments in ... to be passed to f.

    o	par() returns elements in alphabetical order, and "ann" as a
	logical (not integer).

    o	.Platform has a new component GUI specifying the GUI in use
	(which might be "unknown").

    o	plot.formula() searches for a plot method for the left-side of the
	formula before searching for a plot method for the right-side of
	the formula.

    o	New bitmap devices png() and jpeg() on Unix/X11. (They were
	already available on Windows.)

    o	postscript(print.it=TRUE) now does print the plot file.
	postscript(onefile=FALSE) now produces multiple separate files.

    o	provide() is now deprecated.

    o	New function quade.test() in package ctest for the Quade test
	for unreplicated blocked data.

    o	quantile(x, probs) now propagates NA/NaN in probs.

	variable and replay it.

    o	residuals.lm() also allows types "partial" and "response"
	as residuals.glm().

    o	Added col option to rug().

    o	scale() is now generic with scale.default method.

    o	New "call. = TRUE" argument for stop(), and
	new function  stopifnot(.) -- to be used in "make check".

    o	str(.) has a new optional argument "nchar.max = 128" and truncates
	strings longer than that.  Also eliminated a few minor glitches.

    o	The symbols() function is now implemented.

    o	New function termplot() with similar functionality to
	plot.gam() in S.

    o	The parameters to title() which specify the labels may now
	be specified as a list containing the parameter together
	with additional modifying par values (cex, col, font) which
	affect just that label.

	title() also has new line and outer arguments which provide
	functionality which matches that in axis().

    o	New functions which.min() amd which.max().

    o	The Wilcoxon and Ansari-Bradley tests now optionally return
	confidence intervals for the location or scale parameter of
	interest.

    o	New argument `extend' to window() (and updated documentation).

    o	write.table() can now write CSV files in the format Excel expects.

    o	New device xfig() to produce XFig files.

    o	New xyz.coords() utility function to be used for 3D highlevel plots.


    o	R CMD build now also works for package bundles.

    o	Rdconv allows an output file to be specified.

    o	Initial support for C++ source code in add-on packages under Unix.

    o	Mathlib can be built as a standalone library: see directory
	src/nmath/standalone.



BUG FIXES

    o	The Mathlib functions now use exactly the same values for
	+/-Inf, NaN and NA as the rest of R in all cases.

    o	Improved automatic remaking.


    o	option keep.source was not set correctly before the base
	package was loaded: some functions in the base package had
	the source kept.  The memory usage should now be reduced by ca 1Mb.

    o	The base file is no longer closed twice in case of a syntax
	error (caused segfault on Linux).

    o	The X11 data editor scrolls cells and so allows more than ca 10
	characters to be entered.  Several interface/redraw errors
	have been corrected.

    o	Using `destroy' or `close' on the X11 data editor window killed R.

    o	Multiple `destroy' events or X11 errors killed R (PR#400).

    o	Warnings from .Last or closing devices are printed where
	sensible (e.g. not on GNOME nor Windows console).

    o	add1.glm() and drop1.glm() gave incorrect results in the "Chisq"
	test option when the scale was estimated.

    o	aggregate() applied to multiple time series lost the series names.

    o	as.hclust.twins() in package mva sets method=NA (PR#538)

    o	ave(1:3) now works (as when is.null(list()) was TRUE years ago).

    o	barplot(c(0.1, 0.5, 1), ylim = c(0, 1)) now works: [xy]axs="i"
	and exact limits now labels the limits.

    o	by() works when embedded in a function.

    o	The xlab and ylab in coplot() now set the x and y axis labels,
	as in S.  Supply a second component to label the conditioning
	variables.

    o	count.fields() and read.table() now have the same default
	quote = "\"'".

    o	guard against segfault in dataentry(x<-1, Modes = plot), and the like.

    o	dev.print() now checks if the current device is replayable
	(and not all devices were, despite the documentation).

    o	The gtk() device (formerly x11() under GNOME) was incorrectly
	returning character information, so in particular `*' was
	wrongly centred as a plotting symbol.

    o	is.qr() checks not only for $qr, but also for $rank & $qraux, PR#482.

    o	library() will not leave the package on the search path if
	loading fails (including if .First.lib fails).

    o	lqs(, method="S") rounded k0 on passing to C.

    o	na.omit() now handles vectors and matrices as well as data
	frames.

    o	plot.lm(*, which=4) now works thanks to Marcel Wolbers.

    o	postscript() now uses the options "papersize" and "printcmd"
	rather than the values of R_PAPERSIZE in the environment
	and R_PRINTCMD found at build time.

    o	postscript() now makes use of kerning information in computing
	string widths.

    o	M <- 2 ; print(ppr(.., nterms = M))  now works.

    o	ppr(, sm.method="spline") had an internal limit of 250 rows:
	this is now 2500 and is now checked.

    o	predict.lm(,type="terms",se.fit=T) gives correct standard errors
	(thanks to John Maindonald)

    o	print.ftable() now returns its argument.

    o	proj.aovlist() now gives a non-zero result for strata with
	no fitted effects.

    o	qnorm() is now based on AS 241 instead of AS 111, and should
	give precise results up to 16 digits precision.

    o	rgeom(, prob=1) gives 0 rather than NA

    o	rpois(*, lambda) now works when lambda > .Machine$integer.max

    o	strheight("X") with no active device would segfault.

    o	system() is now (partially) functional on systems without popen.

    o	Fixed bug in undoc() - requiring new `chdir' argument
	for sys.source()

    o	Fixed problem in usemethod() where CAR(call) could be non-symbol.

    o	The x11() device no longer crashes R if a font is not found,
	and will warn if there is a size mismatch of more than 10%.


    o	R CMD Rd2dvi now sorts files alphabetically.

    o	Rdconv now reports if an invalid type is specified (rather
	than using latex).

    o	Support for Rd conversion to Sd has been reinstated (it was
	unintentionally removed along with nroff-based conversion to text).

    o	\deqn{} fix in R-exts.texi, PR#523.


    o	Linpack.h now makes clear which routines are actually in R.

    o	Entry-point "pythag" is now loaded even though it is not
	necessarily used in R.	Where "hypot" is available pythag
	just calls hypot after checking for special values.

    o	call_R will now correctly handle character vector arguments.

    o	The alphabet links on top of HTML function indices with more than
	100 entries now contain only the letters which are really
	first letters of at least one entry.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.0.1


BUG FIXES

    o	pgamma(Inf, 1, Inf) gives NaN instead of an infinite loop, PR#462.

    o	Inline xaxt and yaxt parameters were ignored.

    o	Setting the normal RNG was not always recorded in .Random.seed.

    o	\link[pkg]{foo} links were wrongly translated to HTML.

    o	Direct use of show.data() with no args was incorrect.

    o	print.coefmat does sensible things if options
	show.signif.stars and show.coef.Pvalues are not set correctly.

    o	x <- list(a=1, b=2) ; x["c"] <- 3 now (again) stretches the list
	rather than give a "subscript out of bounds" error.

    o	Models with response appearing on rhs could cause segfault.

    o	as.data.frame.matrix will now ensure the columns added have
	non-empty names.

    o	Some (strange?) model formulas could cause memory corruption
	(thanks to John Fox for digging this up).

    o	Matrix multiplication in cases such as 1:3 %*% t(1:2) is accepted.

    o	Options --nsize and --vsize to R CMD check gave warning
	messages and only one was accepted.

    o	The autoload()s during startup are "wrapped" such
	that conflicting objects don't break startup.

    o	cor.test(*, meth="spear") {pkg ctest} now works (again) for n <= 6

    o	scale = 0 in biplot.princomp() now works.

    o	The scores given by princomp(, cor = TRUE) and the rotated
	values given by prcomp(, scale = TRUE) are now computed from the
	scaled data.

    o	barplot now works okay when length(col) < length(legend.txt),
	thanks to Ben Bolker, PR#494.

    o	legend has new args `ncol' and `horiz' thanks to Ben Bolker.

    o	kernel("dirichlet", m=10, r=1) in package ts now works.

    o	save/restore of	 environments containing "..." object should
	work now.

    o	qhyper should work better for large N.

    o	qbinom(1-1e-16, n, p) , qpois() and qnbinom(*) looped for ever.

    o	as.matrix.data.frame no longer escapes quotes in character
	vectors.

    o	R would try to save the readline history at the end of
	non-interactive sessions, causing crashes on some systems.

    o	Subtle roundoff problems caused arrays to be allocated short in
	loess.c in some cases, leading to segfaults.

    o	Document that postscript(file="") sends the output directly to
	the default printer.

    o	ts.union(, dframe=TRUE) had a long-standing typo, now works.

    o	save(, ascii=TRUE) had problem with octal escapes in strings
	when there was a digit following, should work now.

    o	matpoints() and matlines() now also have a "type =" argument
	with defaults "p" and "l", respectively; PR#506.

    o	The new Perl 5.6 broke our version-detection mechanism. A
	better one has been inserted.

    o	X11(colortype="gray") failed to work on 8-bit screens, and
	more generally when colour allocation failed X11() did not
	revert to monochrome correctly (and did not say it was doing so).

	It was not documented in the help that to change the X11
	colortype one needs to close all open X11 devices.

    o	loessf.f in modreg defined DSIGN unecessarily and this caused
	a conflict on AIX.

    o	plot.lm will now work with rlm objects.

    o	start and end behave better when the frequency is not an integer.

    o	aggregate.ts is closer to S-PLUS's aggregate.rts.

    o	quantile(x) now works when x contains several +/- Inf's.

    o	guard against segfault in dataentry(0,0) (or, more
	realistically, when mistyping data.entry(x,y) as
	dataentry(x,y))
