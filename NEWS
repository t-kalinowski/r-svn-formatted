		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.1.0


NEW FEATURES

   o	Faster algorithm in summaryRprof().

   o	update.packages() and old.packages() have a new option
	'checkBuilt' to allow packages installed under earlier
	versions of R to be updated.

   o	na.contiguous() is now (S3) generic with first argument
	renamed to 'object'.

   o	Plotmath now allows underline in expressions.  (PR#7286,
	contributed by Uwe Ligges.)


DOCUMENTATION

   o	File doc/html/faq.html no longer exists, and doc/manual/R-FAQ.html
	(which has active links to other manuals) is used instead.
	(If makeinfo >= 4.5 is not available, the version on CRAN is
	linked to.)


INSTALLATION CHANGES

   o	-D__NO_MATH_INLINES is only used on older ix86 glibc-based
	systems which need it (tested at configure time).

   o	R_XTRA_[CF]FLAGS are now used during the configuration tests,
	and [CF]PICFLAGS if --enable-R-shlib was specified.  This
	ensures that features such as inlining are only used if the
	compilation flags specified support them.  (PR#7257)

   o	Files FAQ, RESOURCES, doc/html/resources.html are no longer in
	the SVN sources but are made by 'make dist'.


BUG FIXES

   o	Configuring for Tcl/Tk makes use of ${TK_LIB_SPEC} ${TK_LIBS}
	not ${TK_LIB_SPEC} ${TK_XLIBSW}, which is correct for
	recent versions of Tk, but conceivably not for old
	tkConfig.sh files.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.0.0 patched


INSTALLATION CHANGES

   o	Building on Alpha OSF/1 no longer forces the C flag -std1,
	which appears to be no longer needed.  (PR#7257)

   o	The compiler flag -mieee-fp is no longer used on i386 Linux
	(these days it is only passed to the linker and was only
	invoked for compilation steps).

   o	If makeinfo >= 4.5 is not available, warnings are given that
	some of the HTML manuals will be missing, and the index page
	given by help.start() will link to CRAN versions of those manuals.

   o	Files aclocal.m4 and acinclude.m4 used in maintainer builds
	are not longer included in the distribution.


BUG FIXES

   o	model.frame.default() takes row names from the response
	variable if that has suitable names and there is no 'data'
	argument.  (This follows S but was not previously implemented
	in R.)

   o	write.table() was not respecting the 'dec' argument for complex
	numbers.

   o	write.table() printed a mixture of numeric and complex numbers
	as all complex.	 (PR#7260)

   o	R CMD INSTALL failed with versioned installs on packages which
	save images (only).

   o	dlogis() gave NaN not 0 for large negative arguments.

   o	Importing from another namespace was broken for versioned
	installs, incorrectly reporting something like
	"package 'imported_from' does not have a name space".

   o	The GNOME interface under Linux/Unix was broken. (PR#7276)

   o	For the jpeg/png devices under Linux/Unix, under certain rare
	circumstances clipping needed to be cleared before starting a
	new page.  (PR#7270, which has been the case since the devices
	were introduced in 1.1.0.)

   o	First lattice plot (first grid.newpage() call) did not start
	a new page IF there had been a previous traditional graphics
	plot (on the same device).

   o	Using install.packages() to install the same package to more
	than one library gave an incorrect warning message.

   o	.packages(all.available=TRUE) returned packages with an invalid
	version field in their DESCRIPTION whereas .find.packages() and
	packageDescription() did not.  Now all do not.

   o	packageDescription() now correctly reports that a package does
	not exist, rather than that its DESCRIPTION file is 'missing
	or broken'.

   o	'make dist' from builddir != sourcedir was copying not linking
	recommended packages to *.tgz.

   o	Slots in prototype objects can inherit from locally defined
	classes (which were not being found correctly before).

   o	Several fixes to the behavior of as() when there are either
	coerce= or replace= methods supplied in a call to
	setIs(). Related fixes to setIs() to handle correctly previous
	methods, if there were any.

   o	splinefun(1[0], 1[0])(1) doesn't segfault anymore (PR#7290).
	spline() and splinefun() now also work with missing values by
	omiting them.

   o	ecdf() was failing on inputs containing NAs. (Part of PR#7292)

   o	tools:::.install_package_description was splitting the Built:
	field across lines on platforms with very long names.
