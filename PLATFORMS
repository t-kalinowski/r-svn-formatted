If you have success on any others, let us know the platform names
and any changes you had to make so we can update this file and
our installation procedures.

NOTES

(1)	Perl version 5 must be installed in order to build
	the documentation.  (The SGI supplied Perl is version 4).

(2)	The Makefile in src/main must be edited manually after
	configuration and the reference to the library "-lSM"
	removed.

(3) 	A number of  users appear to have installation problems with f77,
	requiring the f77 library directory to be explicitly 
	specified in -L and -R 

(4)     (Greg Snow <snow@biostat.washington.edu>)

	It needed the -mieee-with-inexact flag (the default config used 
	-ieee_with_inexact, note the m and the switch from _ to -)

	I also changed a line in plot.c, the line was around 411 (I
	added some printf's for debugging so this is probably not the
	original line number)

	the original line was:
    if (FINITE(asp) && asp > 0 ) {
	my new line is:
    if (FINITE(asp) && asp > 0 && asp != NA_REAL ) {

	Apparently my setup thinks that NA_REAL is positive finite so
	the change was neccesary.
