4. BUG-TRACKING SYSTEM

R has a bug-tracking system (or perhaps a bug-filing system is a more
precise description) available on the net at 

    http://r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk

and via e-mail to r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The R function bug.report() can
be used to invoke an editor from a within an R session and send the
report to the right address. It also fills in some basic information,
such as your R version and operating system, which may be helpful in
the debugging process.
