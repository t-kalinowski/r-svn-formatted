1. FAQ

A collection of Frequently Asked Questions and their answers is
maintained by Kurt Hornik <Kurt.Hornik@ci.tuwien.ac.at> and can be
found at the URL

	http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~hornik/R/R-FAQ.html

A text version is in file FAQ in this directory, and an HTML version
is available as file doc/html/faq.html and via the on-line help (on
the index page given by help.start()).


2. MAILING LISTS

Thanks to Martin Maechler there are number of mailing lists which
are used by R users and developers.  They are

	r-announce@lists.r-project.org 	announcements of new R releases
					or applications,

	r-help@lists.r-project.org	general inquiries and discussion
					about R.

	r-devel@lists.r-project.org	discussions about the future of R 
					and pre-testing of new versions


To subscribe (or unsubscribe) to these mailing list send

(in the "body", not the subject !) to:

	r-announce-request@lists.r-project.org
	r-help-request@lists.r-project.org
	r-devel-request@lists.r-project.org

Archives of the mailing lists are made available monthly; see the
doc/mail/mail.html file on any CRAN node.  An HTML archive is
available via http://www.ens.gu.edu.au/robertk/R/.



3. ARCHIVES

The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) is a collection of sites
which carry identical material, consisting of the R distribution(s),
the contributed extensions, documentation for R, and binaries.

The CRAN master site can be found at the URLs

    http://cran.r-project.org/
or  ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/                  (Austria)

and mirrored at many sites: see the list in the file MIRROR-SITES or
on-line at

    http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html



4. BUG-TRACKING SYSTEM

R has a bug-tracking system (or perhaps a bug-filing system is a more
precise description) available on the net at 

    http:///bugs.r-project.org

and via e-mail to r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The R function bug.report()
can be used to invoke an editor from a within an R session and send
the report to the right address. It also fills in some basic
information, such as your R version and operating system, which has
proved helpful in the debugging process.

The source distribution has a file BUGS at the top level giving a
summary of the entries at the time this distribution was prepared.
