3. ARCHIVES

The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) is a collection of sites
which carry identical material, consisting of the R distribution(s),
the contributed extensions, documentation for R, and binaries.

The CRAN master site can be found at the URLs

    http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/R
or  ftp://ftp.ci.tuwien.ac.at/pub/R/                  (Austria)

and mirrored at many sites: see the list in the file MIRROR-SITES or
on-line at

    http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/R/mirrors.html



4. BUG-TRACKING SYSTEM

R has a bug-tracking system (or perhaps a bug-filing system is a more
precise description) available on the net at 

    http://r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk

and via e-mail to r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The R function bug.report()
can be used to invoke an editor from a within an R session and send
the report to the right address. It also fills in some basic
information, such as your R version and operating system, which has
proved helpful in the debugging process.

A summary of the entries at the time this distribution was prepared is
in file BUGS in this directory.
