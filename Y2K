                         R2K Statement

We expect R to be Y2K compliant when compiled and run on a Y2K compliant
system. In particular R does not internally represent or manipulate dates
as two-digit quantities. However, no guarantee of Y2K compliance is
provided for R. R is free software and comes with NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.  

R, like any other programming language, can be used to write programs
and manipulate data in ways that are not Y2K compliant.
