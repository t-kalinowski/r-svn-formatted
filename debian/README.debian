----------------------

This Debian package was created from the sources on the Comprehensive R Archive
Network sites.  The master site is http://cran.r-project.org/

The executable is called R.

In accordance with the Debian package policy, the executable,
/usr/lib/R/bin/R.binary, has been stripped.  Trying to use the --debugger
option to R may not be as useful as hoped.
