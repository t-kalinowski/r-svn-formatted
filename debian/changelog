r-base (1.8.1.cvs.20040229-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Declare Replaces: r-recommended as well for r-base-html

  * Upgraded to release candidate 2004-02-29 of R 1.9.0
  
  * debian/rules changes to configure call
     --without-r-recommended (as r-recommended is now a meta-package)
     --with-bzlib to override default of no
     --with-pcre to override default of no
     --with-zlib to override default of no
     R_BROWSER=sensible-browser to not depend on mozilla

  * debian/control: r-base-core Replace r-recommended (<= 1.8.1-1) as 
    the grid package moved 
  
  * debian/control: r-recommended is now a metapackage that depends on the
    individual packages which are now part of the Debian distribution; 
    and added appropriate Depends for all of them
  * debian/rules: Hence 'configure [...] --without-recommended-packages	[...]'
  * debian/control: Added Conflicts: r-recommended (<< 1.9.0) to r-base-core
  
  * debian/rules: In make-arch target, now call "make docs" with 
    R_CMD_BUILD_HELP_OPTS="--txt --example" to build only the documentation 
    needed for binary-arch targets (thanks to Kurt Hornik for enabling this)
  
  * debian/rules: configure with PAGER=/usr/bin/pager as all the good
    reasons pointed out in #230524 regarding octave2.1 apply to R too
  
  * debian/control: Depends for r-base-dev changed from the imperfect 
    "g77 | f2c" to to "g77 | m68k, f2c | not+m68k, type-handling" with 
    thanks to Wouter Verhelst
  
  * debian/control: Changed Build-Depends from 'blas-dev (>=1.0-9),lapack-dev'
     to 'refblas3-dev | atlas3-base-dev, lapack3-dev | atlas3-base-dev'

  * Upgraded to 1.8.0 patched as of 2003-10-24
  * Also upgraded R-recommended via rsync
  * To avoid possible upgrade conflicts with pre-releases of 1.8.1, we 
    use previously used ".cvs.YYYYMMDD" naming convention for the package
  * debian/rules: 'make {docs,help,html}' are now called in binary-indep
    which was not possible with earlier versions of R; however as make
    recommended implies make doc, we manually descend into its top dir.

r-base (1.8.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * With a big thanks to Camm Maguire for investigating this problem,
    we are reverting back to the previously used setup of defaulting to 
    Blas while automagically switching to Atlas where installed:
    - debian/rules: Patch R.sh.in to disable use of R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH (beyond
      the required $R_HOME/nbin) which conflicts with Debian's transparent 
      switch of Atlas for Blas (as /usr/lib/libblas would be found instead)
    - debian/rules: Configure again with --with-blas=blas
    - debian/control: Hence remove Depends: on atlas2-base-dev | atlas2-dev
    - debian/shlibs.local: Remove, no longer needed
    - debian/rules: No longer need to postprocess Depends
    - debian/rules: Other small cleanups

  * Upgraded to release candidate 2003-08-08 of R 1.7.2 (or 1.8.0)

    r-recommended package so tools/rsync-recommended was used to obtain
    these and a new, Debian-only, orig.tar.gz of both was created
