Description: GNU R statistical computing language and environment
 R is `GNU S' - A language and environment for statistical computing
 and graphics. R is similar to the award-winning S system, which was
 developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers et al. It provides a
 wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques (linear and
 nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis,
 classification, clustering, ...).
 .
 R is designed as a true computer language with control-flow
 constructions for iteration and alternation, and it allows users to
 add additional functionality by defining new functions. For
 computationally intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be
 linked and called at run time.
 .
 S is the statistician's Matlab and R is to S what Octave is to Matlab.
 .
 This packages is a meta-package which eases the transition from the 
 pre-1.5.0 package setup with its larger r-base package. Once installed, it 
 can be safely removed and apt-get will automatically upgrade its components
 during future upgrades.  Providing this packages gives a way to users to 
 then only install r-base-core (but not, say, r-base-latex) if they so desire.

 As of R 2.1.0, this interface is no longer provided with the upstream
 sources. As such, this package is now an empty stub that will be removed
 in a subsequent revision of the Debian package.

 This Debian package is now a metapackage that depends on a set of 
 packages that are recommended by the upstream R core team as part of a 
 complete R distribution, and distributed along with the source of R 
 itself, as well as directly via the CRAN network of mirrors. This set
 comprises the following packages (listed in their upstream names):
  - KernSmooth: Functions for kernel smoothing for Wand & Jones (1995)
  - VR: The MASS, class, nnet and spatial packages from Venables and
    Ripley, `Modern Applied Statistics with S' (4th edition).
  - boot: Bootstrap R (S-Plus) Functions from the book "Bootstrap Methods 
    and Their Applications" by A.C. Davison and D.V. Hinkley (1997).
  - cluster: Functions for clustering (by Rousseeuw et al.)
  - foreign: Read data stored by Minitab, S, SAS, SPSS, Stata, ...
  - lattice: Implementation of Trellis (R) graphics
  - mgcv: Multiple smoothing parameter estimation and GAMs by GCV
  - nlme: Linear and nonlinear mixed effects models
  - rpart: Recursive partitioning and regression trees
  - survival: Survival analysis, including penalised likelihood.
