Description: GNU R statistical computing language and environment
 R is `GNU S' - A language and environment for statistical computing
 and graphics. R is similar to the award-winning S system, which was
 developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers et al. It provides a
 wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques (linear and
 nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis,
 classification, clustering, ...).
 .
 R is designed as a true computer language with control-flow
 constructions for iteration and alternation, and it allows users to
 add additional functionality by defining new functions. For
 computationally intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be
 linked and called at run time.
 .
 S is the statistician's Matlab and R is to S what Octave is to Matlab.
 .
 This packages is a meta-package which eases the transition from the 
 pre-1.5.0 package setup with its larger r-base package. Once installed, it 
 can be safely removed and apt-get will automatically upgrade its components
 during future upgrades.  Providing this packages gives a way to users to 
 then only install r-base-core (but not, say, r-base-latex) if they so desire.
