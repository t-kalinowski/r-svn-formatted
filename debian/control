Description: `GNU S' - A language and environment for statistical computing.
 R is described by its authors as "not unlike" S, which is a language
 developed at Bell Laboratories for statistical computing and graphics.
 It provides support for a variety of statistical and graphical analyses.
 R is a true computer language which contains a number of control-flow
 constructions for iteration and alternation.  It allows users to add
 additional functionality by defining new functions.  Fortran and C
 code can be linked and called at run time.
 .
 S is the statistician's Matlab and R is to S what Octave is to Matlab.
 .
 Versions 0.90.0 and higher have R functions CRAN.packages, install.packages,
 and update.packages that can be used to select and update R packages from the
 Comprehensive R Archive Network.  The Debian packages r-cran, r-cran-non-free,
 and r-mlbench are no longer needed and have been withdrawn.
