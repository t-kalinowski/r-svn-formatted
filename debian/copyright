This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-base package of the GNU R system for
statistical computing and graphics.

R was initially written by Ross Ihaka <Ross.Ihaka@r-project.org> and
Robert Gentleman of the University of Auckland in Auckland, New
Zealand.  Since mid-1997 there has been a core group (the "R Core
Team") who can modify the R source code CVS archive.  The group
currently consists of Doug Bates, John Chambers, Peter Dalgaard,
Robert Gentleman, Kurt Hornik, Stefano Iacus, Ross Ihaka, Friedrich
Leisch, Thomas Lumley, Martin Maechler, Duncan Murdoch, Paul Murrell,
Martyn Plummer, Brian Ripley, Duncan Temple Lang, and Luke Tierney.

R has a home page at `http://www.r-project.org/'.  It is free software
distributed under a GNU-style copyleft, and an official part of the GNU
project ("GNU S").

This package was initially debianized by Douglas Bates bates@stat.wisc.edu on
Wed, 10 Dec 1997 14:17:31 -0600. 

Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org> currently maintaines the package.  

Sources were downloaded from http://cran.r-project.org/src/ and changes,
typically only to files in the debian/ directory are fully documented in the
file /usr/share/doc/r-base/changelog.Debian.gz.

The file COPYRIGHTS of the upstream R sources is included below. On Debian
GNU/Linux systems, the complete text of the licenses referred to below as
COPYING and COPYING.LIB can be found in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL and
/usr/share/common-licenses/LGPL.

COPYRIGHT STATUS

The bulk of this code is copyright by members of or all of the R
Development Core Team.

See the file COPYING for the exact conditions under which you may
redistribute it.

	---------------------------------------------------

The public header files and import libraries are distributed under the
more permissive terms of the file COPYING.LIB.  This applies only to
the files

src/include/R.h
src/include/Rdefines.h
src/include/Rgraphics.h
src/include/Rinternals.h
src/include/Rmath.h
src/include/S.h
src/include/R_ext/*.h
src/gnuwin32/R.exp (a generated file in binary distributions only)
src/main/R.exp,  generated by tools/ldAIX4 whilst building R on AIX.

From the announcement of the change (2001-Feb-05)

    It came to our attention that some projects are interpreting GPL to
    mean that compiling against the header files or linking against a
    Windows import library brings the compiled code under the scope of
    GPL.  This would mean it would be impossible to distribute binary
    versions of non-GPL packages with compiled code which called entry
    points in the R executable or DLL, of which there are many on CRAN.

    We encourage packages to be distributed under Open Source conditions,
    but accept that this is not possible for some contributions.  Our
    intention is that export files and import libraries be `accessors'
    under clause 5 of the LGPL, so that in most cases no (additional)
    restrictions are imposed by compiling a package using the LGPL-ed
    components of R.

    To avoid any anomalies, the versions of the same files in R versions
    1.0.0 to 1.2.1 may also be used under LGPL or GPL.
