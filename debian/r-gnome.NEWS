r-gnome (2.0.1.alpha.20050403-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * The experimental and incomplete Gnome UI is no longer included 
    in the upstream R sources as of the R 2.1.0 release. 
  
    Hence, this Debian package is now an empty transition package 
    which will eventually disappear.
  
    The old code for the R Gnome frontend is still available via
    svn co https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/gnomeGUI
