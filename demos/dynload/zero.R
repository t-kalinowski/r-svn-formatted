# Notes:
#
# 1. Because of the difference in scoping rules between R and S
#    it is not necessary (and indeed an error) to assign the function
#    in frame 1.  The function f.check can see the function f because
#    it exists in the environment where f is defined.
#
# 2. It is also not necessary (although permissible) to wrap a
#    "list" around the function f.check in the .C call.  R passes
#    such functions through to the underlying C code in "undigested"
#    form.  Corresponding, the underlying C code does not need to
#    extract the function from the passed "list".

##-- you may need to change this to

##-- substituting the proper path for <RHOME>,
