<tt>Introduction</tt></FONT></h2>

<p>
<B>R</B> is a computer language not entirely unlike the S language developed
at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Rick Becker, John Chambers and Allan
Wilks. The two languages are implemented quite differently, but bear
enough superficial resemblence that users should be able to switch
between the two with relative ease.
 
Currently the software is undergoing active development.  Discussion
of the development process is carried out on the "r-devel" mailing
list.  See the <a href="resource.html">resources page</a> for details on
how to subscribe to this list.

<P>
We have implemented <B>R</B> in what we hope is a very portable fashion
and in way which requires relatively little in the way of machine resources.
Versions of the language exist for many <B>Unix</B>
platforms including <B>FreeBSD</B>, <B>NetBSD</B>, <B>Linux</B>,
<b>Irix</b>, <b>Solarias</b> and <b>HPUX</b>.
In addition there are versions for <B>Macintosh</B>,
<B>Power Macintosh</B> and <B>Microsoft Windows (3.1, 95, NT)</b>.

Present Status</tt></FONT></h2>

The present version implements most of the functionality in the
first S book (the "Blue Book") and many of the applications.  In
addition, we have implemented a certain amount of functionality
from the second S book (the "White Book").  In particular we have
a functioning versions of "lm" and "glm" and their associated
"summary" and "anova" methods (it would be nice to have "drop1",
"add1" and "step", but there hasn't been time to complete these
yet).

What we have in the way of manual is in the directory in an
"output independent" form which can be used to create versions
for HTML, LaTeX, troff etc.
