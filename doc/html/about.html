<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
<B>R</B> is a computer language not entirely unlike the S language developed
at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories by Rick Becker, John Chambers and Allan
Wilks. The two languages are implemented quite differently, but bear
enough superficial resemblence that users should be able to switch
between the two with relative ease.
 
Currently the software is undergoing active development.  Discussion
of the development process is carried out on the "r-devel" mailing
list.  See the <a href="resource.html">resources page</a> for details on
how to subscribe to this list.

<P>
We have implemented <B>R</B> in what we hope is a very portable
fashion and in way which requires relatively little in the way of
machine resources.  Implementations exist for many <B>Unix</B>
platforms including <B>FreeBSD</B>, <B>NetBSD</B>, <B>Linux</B>,
<b>Irix</b>, <b>Solaris</b>, <b>OSF/1</b>, <b>AIX</b> and <b>HPUX</b>.
In addition there is a version for <B>Microsoft Windows (9x, NT,
2000)</b>.

<h2>Present Status</h2>

The present version implements most of the functionality in the 1988 S
book (the "Blue Book") and many of the applications.  In addition, we
have implemented much of the functionality from the 1992 S book (the
"White Book").  In particular we have versions of "lm", "glm", "aov"
and "loess" and "tree" is available as a contributed package.

There are several manuals in the distribution, plus a comprehensive
set of help pages in "output independent" form which can be used to
create versions for HTML, LaTeX, text, PDF etc.
