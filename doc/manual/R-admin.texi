Sources, binaries and documentation for @R{} can be obtained via

@section Getting and unpacking the sources
@cindex Sources for R

The simplest way is to download the most recent
@file{R-@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}.tgz} file, and unpack it with

@example
tar xvfz R-@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}.tgz
@end example

@noindent
on systems that have @acronym{GNU} @command{tar} installed.  On other
systems you need at least to have the @command{gzip} program installed.
Then you can use

@example
gzip -dc R-@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}.tgz | tar xvf -
@end example

The pathname of the directory into which the sources are unpacked should
not contain spaces, as @command{make} (specifically @acronym{GNU}
@command{make} 3.80) does not expect spaces.

If you need to transport the sources on floppy disks, you can download
the @file{R-@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}.tgz-split.*} files and paste them
together at the destination with (Unix)

@example
cat R-@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}-split.* > R-@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}.tgz
@end example

@noindent
and proceed as above.  If you want the build to be usable by a group of
users, set @code{umask} before unpacking so that the files will be
readable by the target group (e.g., @code{umask 022} to be usable by all
users).


@node Getting patched and development versions,  , Getting and unpacking the sources, Obtaining R
@section Getting patched and development versions

A patched version of the current release, @samp{r-patched} and the
current development version, @samp{r-devel}, are available as daily
tarballs and via access to the R Subversion repository.

The tarballs are available from
@url{ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/pub/Software/R/,
@code{ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/@/pub/@/Software/R/}}.  Download
either @file{R-patched.tar.gz} or @file{R-devel.tar.gz} (or the
@file{.tar.bz2} versions) and unpack as described in the previous
section.  They are built in exactly the same way as distributions of R
releases.

@end menu

@node Using Subversion and rsync,  , Getting patched and development versions, Getting patched and development versions
@subsection Using Subversion and rsync
@cindex Subversion

Sources are also available via @url{https://svn.R-project.org/R/}, the R
Subversion repository.  If you have a Subversion client (see
@url{http://subversion.tigris.org/, @code{subversion.tigris.org}}), you
can check out and update the current r-devel from
@url{https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/} and the current r-patched from
@samp{https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-@var{x}-@var{y}-patches/}
(where @var{x} and @var{y} are the major and minor number of the current
released version of R).  E.g., use

@example
svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/ @var{path}
@end example

@noindent
to check out r-devel into directory @var{path}.

Note that @samp{https:} is required, and that the SSL certificate for
the Subversion server of the R project is

@example
Certificate information:
 - Hostname: svn.r-project.org
 - Valid: from Jul 16 08:10:01 2004 GMT until Jul 14 08:10:01 2014 GMT
 - Issuer: Department of Mathematics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, CH
 - Fingerprint: c9:5d:eb:f9:f2:56:d1:04:ba:44:61:f8:64:6b:d9:33:3f:93:6e:ad
@end example

@noindent
(currently, there is no ``trusted certificate'').  You can accept this
certificate permanently and will not be asked about it anymore.

Note that retrieving the sources by e.g. @command{wget -r} or @command{svn export}
from that URL will not work: the Subversion information is needed to build @R{}.

The Subversion repository does not contain the current sources for the
recommended packages, which can be obtained by @command{rsync} or
downloaded from @acronym{CRAN}.  To use @code{rsync} to install the
appropriate sources for the recommended packages, run
@code{./tools/rsync-recommended} from the top-level of the @R{} sources.

If downloading manually from @acronym{CRAN}, do ensure that you have the
correct versions of the recommended packages: if the number in the file
@file{VERSION} is @samp{@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}} you need to download
the contents of @samp{http://CRAN.R-project.org/src/contrib/@var{dir}},
where @var{dir} is @samp{@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}/Recommended} for
r-devel or @file{@var{x}.@var{y}-patched/Recommended} for r-patched,
respectively, to directory @file{src/library/Recommended} in the sources
you have unpacked.  After downloading manually you need to execute
@command{tools/link-recommended} from the top level of the sources to
make the requisite links in @file{src/library/Recommended}.  A suitable
incantation from the top level of the R sources using @command{wget}
might be

@example
wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A\*.gz -nd -P src/library/Recommended \
  http://CRAN.R-project.org/src/contrib/@var{dir}
./tools/link-recommended

@node Simple compilation, Making the manuals, Installing R under Unix-alikes, Installing R under Unix-alikes
@section Simple compilation

First review the essential and useful tools and libraries in
@ref{Essential and useful other programs in Unix}, and install those you
want or need.  Ensure that the environment variable @env{TMPDIR} is
either unset (and @file{/tmp} exists and can be written in and executed
from) or points to a valid temporary directory.

@findex R_HOME
Choose a place to install the @R{} tree (@R{} is not just a binary, but
has additional data sets, help files, font metrics etc).  Let us call
this place @var{R_HOME}.  Untar the source code.  This should create
directories @file{src}, @file{doc}, and several more.  (At this point
North American readers should consult @ref{Setting paper size}.)  Issue
the following commands:

@findex configure

@example
./configure
make
@end example

@noindent
(See @ref{Using make} if your make is not called @samp{make}.)

Then check the built system works correctly, by

@example
make check
@end example

@noindent
Failures are not necessarily problems as they might be caused by missing
functionality, but you should look carefully at any reported
discrepancies.  (Also, the @file{d-p-q-r-tests.R} is random and will
fail about 1 in 50 runs, so if this fails please re-run @command{make
check}.)  To re-run the tests including those successfully run you would
need

@example
make check FORCE=FORCE
@end example

More comprehensive testing can be done by

@example
make check-devel
@end example

@noindent
or

@example
make check-all
@end example

@noindent
see @file{tests/README}.

If the command @command{configure} and @command{make} commands execute
successfully, the @R{} binary will be copied to
@file{@var{R_HOME}/bin/exec/R}.  In addition, a shell-script front-end
called @file{R} will be created and copied to the same directory.  You
can copy this script to a place where users can invoke it, for example
to @file{/usr/local/bin/R}.  You could also copy the man page @file{R.1}
to a place where your @command{man} reader finds it, such as
@file{/usr/local/man/man1}.  If you want to install the complete @R{}
tree to, e.g., @file{/usr/local/lib/R}, see @ref{Installation}.  Note:
you do not @emph{need} to install @R{}: you can run it from where it was
built.

You do not necessarily have to build @R{} in the top-level source
directory (say, @file{@var{TOP_SRCDIR}}).  To build in
@file{@var{BUILDDIR}}, run

@findex configure

@example
cd @var{BUILDDIR}
@var{TOP_SRCDIR}/configure
make
@end example

@noindent
and so on, as described further below.  This has the advantage of always
keeping your source tree ``clean''.  (You may need @acronym{GNU}
@command{make} to allow this, and the pathname of the build directory
should not contain spaces.)

@cindex Help pages
Make will also build plain text help pages as well as @HTML{} and
@LaTeX{} versions of the @R{} object documentation (the three kinds can
also be generated separately using @code{make help}, @code{make html}
and @code{make latex}).  Note that you need Perl version 5: if this is
not available on your system, you can obtain PDF versions of the
documentation files via @acronym{CRAN}.

For those obtaining @R{} @emph{via} Subversion, one additional step is
necessary:
@cindex Vignettes
@cindex Subversion

@example
make vignettes
@end example

@noindent
which makes the @samp{grid} vignettes (which are contained in the tarballs):
it takes several minutes.

Now @code{rehash} if necessary, type @kbd{R}, and read the @R{} manuals
and the @R{} @acronym{FAQ} (files @file{FAQ} or
@file{doc/manual/R-FAQ.html}, or
@url{http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html,
@code{CRAN.R-project.org/@/doc/@/FAQ/@/R-FAQ.html}} which always has
the latest version).

@node Making the manuals, Installation, Simple compilation, Installing R under Unix-alikes
@section Making the manuals
@cindex Manuals

There is a set of manuals that can be built from the sources,

@table @samp
@item refman
Printed versions of all the help pages.
@item R-FAQ
R @acronym{FAQ}
@item R-intro
``An Introduction to R''.
@item R-data
``R Data Import/Export''.
@item R-admin
``R Installation and Administration'', this manual.
@item R-exts
``Writing R Extensions''.
@item R-lang
``The R Language Definition''.
@end table

@noindent
To make these, use

@example
make dvi      @r{to create DVI versions}
make pdf      @r{to create PDF versions}
make info     @r{to create info files (not @samp{refman}).}
@end example

You will not be able to build the info files unless you have
@command{makeinfo} version 4.7 or later installed.

The DVI versions can be previewed and printed using standard programs
such as @command{xdvi} and @command{dvips}.  The PDF versions can be
viewed using Acrobat Reader or (fairly recent versions of)
@command{xpdf} and @command{ghostscript}: they have hyperlinks that can
be followed in the first two.  The info files are suitable for reading
online with Emacs or the standalone @acronym{GNU} Info.  The DVI and PDF
versions will be created using the papersize selected at configuration
(default ISO a4):  this can be overridden by setting @env{R_PAPERSIZE}
on the @command{make} command line, or setting @env{R_PAPERSIZE} in the
environment and using @command{make -e}.  (If re-making the manuals for
a different papersize, you should first delete the file
@file{doc/manual/version.texi}.)

There are some issues with making the reference manual, and in
particular with the PDF version @file{refman.pdf}.  The help files
contain both ISO Latin1 characters (e.g. in @file{text.Rd}) and upright
quotes, neither of which are contained in the standard @LaTeX{} Computer
Modern fonts.  We have provided four alternatives:

@table @code
@item times
Using standard PostScript fonts.  This works well both for on-screen
viewing and for printing, and is the default.  The one disadvantage is
that the Usage and Examples sections may come out rather wide.

@item lm
Using the @emph{Latin Modern} fonts.  These are not often installed as
part of a @TeX{} distribution, but can obtained from
@url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/lm,
@code{www.ctan.org/@/tex-archive/@/fonts/@/ps-type1/@/lm}} and
mirrors.  This uses fonts rather similar to Computer Modern, but is not
so good on-screen as @code{times}.

@item cm-super
Using type-1 versions of the Computer Modern fonts by Vladimir Volovich.
This is a large installation, obtainable from
@url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/cm-super,
@code{www.ctan.org/@/tex-archive/@/fonts/@/ps-type1/@/cm-super}}
and its mirrors.  These type-1 fonts have poor hinting and so are
nowhere near so readable on-screen as the other three options.

@item ae
A package to use composites of Computer Modern fonts.  This works well
most of the time, and its PDF is more readable on-screen than the
previous two options.  There are three fonts for which it will need to
use bitmapped fonts, @file{tctt0900.600pk}, @file{tctt1000.600pk} and
@file{tcrm1000.600pk}.  Unfortunately, if those files are not available,
Acrobat Reader will substitute completely incorrect glyphs so you need
to examine the logs carefully.  This was the default in @R{} version
1.x.y.
@end table

Both Unix and Windows installations default to @code{times}.  The choice
can be overridden by setting the environment variable @env{R_RD4PDF}.
(On Unix, this will be picked up at install time.)  The default value is
@code{times,hyper}: omit @code{hyper} if you do not want hyperlinks,
e.g. for printing.


@node Installation, Uninstallation, Making the manuals, Installing R under Unix-alikes
@section Installation
@cindex Installation

To ensure that the installed tree is usable by the right group of users,
set @code{umask} appropriately (perhaps to @samp{022}) before unpacking
the sources and throughout the build process.

After

@findex configure
@example
./configure
make
make check
@end example

@noindent
have been completed successfully, you can install the complete @R{} tree
to your system by typing

@example
make install
@end example

@noindent
This will install to the following directories:

@table @file
@item @var{prefix}/bin or @var{bindir}
the front-end shell script
@item @var{prefix}/man/man1 or @var{mandir}/man1
the man page
@item @var{prefix}/@var{LIBnn}/R or @var{libdir}/R
all the rest (libraries, on-line help system, @dots{}).  Here
@var{LIBnn} is usually @samp{lib}, but may be @samp{lib64} on some
64-bit Linux systems.
@end table

@noindent
where @var{prefix} is determined during configuration (typically
@file{/usr/local}) and can be set by running @command{configure} with
the option @option{--prefix}, as in

@findex configure
@example
./configure --prefix=/where/you/want/R/to/go
@end example

@noindent
This causes @command{make install} to install the @R{} executable to
@file{/where/you/want/R/to/go/bin}, and so on.  The prefix of the
installation directories can be seen in the status message that is
displayed at the end of @command{configure}.  You can install into
another directory tree by using

@example
make prefix=/path/to/here install
@end example

@noindent
at least with GNU @command{make}.

More precise control is available at configure time via options: see
@command{configure --help} for details.  (However, many of them are
currently unused.)

Configure options @option{--bindir} and @option{--mandir} are supported
and govern where a copy of the @command{R} script and the @command{man}
page are installed.

The configure option @option{--libdir} controls where the main @R{} files
are installed: the default is

@c <FIXME: What is EPREFIX?>
@example
libdir=EPREFIX/$@{LIBnn@}
@end example
@c </FIXME>

All of @code{bindir} and @code{mandir} and @code{libdir} can also be
specified on the @command{make install} command line.

The @command{configure} or @command{make} variables @code{rdocdir} and
@code{rsharedir} can be used to install the system-independent
@file{doc} and @file{share} directories to somewhere other than
@code{libdir}.  The C header files can be installed to the value of
@code{rincludedir}: note that as the headers are not installed into a
subdirectory you probably want something like
@code{rincludedir=/usr/local/include/R-@value{VERSIONno}}.

If you have made @R{} as a shared/dynamic library you can install it in
your system's library directory by

@example
make prefix=/path/to/here install-libR
@end example

@noindent
where @code{prefix} is optional, and @code{libdir} will give more
precise control.


@cindex Manuals, installing

To install DVI, info and PDF versions of the manuals, use one or more of

@example
make install-dvi
make install-info
make install-pdf
@end example

@noindent
Once again, it is optional to specify @code{prefix}.  

More precise control is possible.  For info, the setting used is that of
@code{infodir} (default @code{@var{prefix}/info}, set by configure
option @option{--infodir}).  The DVI and PDF files are installed into
the @R{} @file{doc} tree, set by the @command{make} variable
@code{rdocdir}.

@node Uninstallation, Sub-architectures, Installation, Installing R under Unix-alikes
@section Uninstallation

You can uninstall @R{} by

@example
make uninstall
@end example

@noindent
specifying @code{prefix} etc in the same way as specified for
installation.

This will also uninstall any installed manuals.  There are specific
targets to uninstall DVI, info and PDF manuals in
@file{doc/manual/Makefile}.


@node Sub-architectures,  , Uninstallation, Installing R under Unix-alikes
@section Sub-architectures

@strong{This is an experimental feature that may be released in @R{} 2.3.0.}

Some platforms can support closely related builds of @R{} which can share
all but the executables and dynamic objects.  Examples include builds
under Solaris for different chips (in particular, 32- and 64-bit
builds), 64- and 32- bit builds on @cputype{x86_64} Linux and different
CPUs (@cputype{ppc}, @cputype{ppc64} and @cputype{i386}) under MacOS 10.4.

@R{} supports the idea of architecture-specific builds, specified by
adding @samp{r_arch=@var{name}} to the @command{configure} line.  Here
@var{name} can be anything non-empty, and is used to name subdirectories
of @file{lib}, @code{etc}, @code{include} and @code{libs}.  Example
names from other systems are the use of @file{sparcv9} on Solaris and
@file{32} by @code{gcc} on @cputype{x86_64} Linux.

If you have two or more such builds you can install them over each other
(and one build can be done without @samp{r_arch}).  The space savings
can be considerable: on @cputype{x86_64} Linux a basic install (without
debugging symbols) took 63Mb, and adding a 32-bit build added 6Mb.  If
you have installed multiple build you can select which build to run by

@example
R --arch=@var{name}
@end example

@noindent
and running @samp{R} will run the last build that was installed.

@code{R CMD INSTALL} will detect if more that one build is installed and
try to install packages with the appropriate library objects for each.
This will not be done if the package has an executable @code{configure}
script or a @file{src/Makefile} file.  In such cases you can install for
extra builds by

@example
R --arch=@var{name} CMD INSTALL --libs-only @var{pkg(s)}
@end example

@chapter Installing R under Windows
@cindex Installing under Windows

The @file{bin/windows} directory of a @acronym{CRAN} site contains
binaries for a base distribution and a large number of add-on packages
from @acronym{CRAN} to run on Windows 95, 98, NT4, 2000, ME, XP and 2003
(at least) on Intel x86 and clones (including AMD64/EM64T ships and

Your file system must allow long file names (as is likely except
perhaps for some network-mounted systems).

Installation is @emph{via} the installer @file{@value{RWVERSION}.exe}.
Just double-click on the icon and follow the instructions.  You can
uninstall @R{} from the Control Panel.  (Note that you will probably be
asked to choose a language for installation, and that choice applies to
both installation and un-installation but not to running @R{} itself.)

@url{http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/,

Be sure to set your path in the order given in the appendix.

@node Getting the source files, Building the core files, Getting the tools, Building from source
@subsection Getting the source files

You need to collect the following sets of files:
@itemize

@item
Get the @R{} source code @file{R-@value{VERSIONno}.tgz} from
@acronym{CRAN}.  Open a command window (or another shell) at a
directory @emph{whose path does not contain spaces}.  We will call this
directory @var{R_HOME} below.  Run

@example
tar zxvf R-@value{VERSIONno}.tgz
@end example

@noindent
to create the source tree in @var{R_HOME}.  @strong{Beware}: do use
@command{tar} to extract the sources rather than broken tools such as
WinZip that don't understand about symbolic links.

It is also possible to obtain the source code using Subversion; see 
@ref{Obtaining R} for details.

@item

@item
Optionally, you can install a version of ATLAS
(@url{http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/,

algebra routines. Pre-built @file{Rblas.dll} for various Pentium and
AthlonXP chips are available in the @file{windows/contrib/ATLAS} area on
@acronym{CRAN}.

Another possibility is to use AMD's AMD Core Math Library (ACML)
@url{http://www.amd.com/acml, @code{www.amd.com/@/acml}}.  To use the
Cygwin-compiled version (Cygwin itself is not needed, at least
currently), install @file{acml-2-7-0-win32-g77.exe} (or later) and edit
@file{@var{R_HOME}/@/src/@/gnuwin32/MkRules} to define
@code{USE_ACML=YES} and set @code{ACML_PATH} to the path to
@file{libacml.a}.  If you also set @code{USE_ACML_LAPACK=YES}, ACML will
be used to provide the LAPACK library for R itself and any packages
using @code{$LAPACK_LIBS} built under that setting.

There used to be support for Kazushige Goto's BLAS, but this is no
longer available for Windows, and it seems that it will in future only
to be offered via a source-code licence.

lower case) did not work.

Open a command window at @file{@var{R_HOME}/src/gnuwin32}.  Edit

Notes:
@itemize
@item
The file @file{bin/Rchtml.dll} is only built if CHM help is specified in

By default Doug Lea's @code{malloc} in the file
@file{@var{R_HOME}/src/gnuwin32/malloc.c} is used for R's internal memory
allocations.  You can opt out of this by commenting the line
@code{LEA_MALLOC=YES} in @file{MkRules}, in which case the
@code{malloc} in @file{msvcrt.dll} is used.  This does work but
imposes a considerable performance penalty.

@item
You can run a parallel make by e.g.

but this is only likely to be worthwhile on a dual-processor (or
perhaps a hyperthreaded P4) machine with ample (at least 384Mb) of

@node Building the installer, Cross-building on ix86 Linux, Building the manuals, Building from source
@subsection Building the installer

You need to have the files for a complete R build, including bitmap and
Tcl/Tk support and the manuals, as well as the recommended packages and
Inno Setup (@pxref{The Inno Setup installer}).

Once everything is set up

@example
make distribution
make check-all
@end example

@noindent
will make all the pieces and the installers and put them in the
@file{gnuwin32/cran} subdirectory, then check the build.  This works by
building all the parts in the sequence:

@example
Rpwd.exe @r{(a utility needed in the build)}
rbuild-no-mbcs @r{(the non-East Asian version of @file{R.dll})}
rbuild @r{(the executables, the @acronym{FAQ} docs etc.)}
rpackage @r{(the base packages)}
htmldocs @r{(the @acronym{HTML} documentation)}
bitmapdll @r{(the bitmap support files)}
recommended @r{(the recommended packages)}
vignettes @r{(the vignettes in package @strong{grid}:}
	  @r{ only needed if building from svn checkout)}
manuals @r{(the PDF manuals)}
rinstaller @r{(the install program)}
crandir @r{(the @acronym{CRAN} distribution directory)}
@end example

The parts can be made individually if a full build is not needed, but
earlier parts must be built before later ones.  (The @file{Makefile}
doesn't enforce this dependency---some build targets force a lot of
computation even if all files are up to date.)  The first, third, fourth
and fifth targets are the default build if just @samp{make} is run, but
the second (which builds the default version of @file{R.dll}) needs to
be run first.

If you want to customize the installation by adding extra packages,
replace @code{make rinstaller} by something like

@example
make rinstaller EXTRA_PKGS='pkg1 pkg2 pkg3'
@end example


An alternative way to customize the installer starting with a binary
distribution is to first make a full installation of R from the standard
installer (that is, select @samp{Full Installation} from the
@samp{Select Components} screen), then add packages and make other
customizations to that installation.  Then in
@file{src/gnuwin32/installer} run

@example
make myR IMAGEDIR=rootdir
@end example

@noindent
where @file{rootdir} is the path to the root of the customized
installation (forward slashes and no spaces, please).  This creates an
executable with the standard name, @file{@value{RWVERSION}.exe}, so
please rename it to indicate that it is customized.

It is possible to cross-build @R{} or packages on @cputype{ix86} Linux,
and the @cputype{ix86} cross-compilers have also been used successfully
on @cputype{x86_64} Linux.

You will need i386-mingw32 cross-compilers installed and in your path.
There is currently a complete set of tools at
@url{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/mingw-cross5.tar.bz2,
@code{www.stats.ox.ac.uk/@/pub/@/Rtools/@/mingw-cross5.tar.bz2}} (Just
unpack this somewhere and put its @file{bin} directory in your path.)

You will need @code{Perl}, @command{zip} and @command{unzip} installed
and @command{makeinfo} version 4.7 or later (part of GNU
@code{texinfo}).

You also need the R source (@file{R-@value{VERSIONno}.tgz}).

Then: untar @file{R-@value{VERSIONno}.tgz} somewhere, and

@example
cd /somewhere/R-@value{VERSIONno}/src/gnuwin32
@end example

Edit @file{MkRules} to set @code{BUILD=CROSS} and the appropriate
paths (including @code{HEADER}) as needed.

Edit @file{MkRules} to set the type(s) of help that you want built. (You
will not be able to cross-build @file{.chm} files, so @code{WINHELP} is
automatically set to @code{NO}.)

You also need a working copy of @emph{this version} of @R{} on Linux:
uncomment and set @code{R_EXE} in @file{MkRules} to point to it.

Then run @code{make} (and parallel make works reliably, unlike on Windows).

Packages can be made in the same way as natively: see @ref{Add-on packages}.

(It is possible to cross-build the installers using WINE, which we
leave as an exercise for the reader.)

To distribute a cross-build (or just to transfer it to a Windows machine
for testing) use

@example
cd installer
make imagedir
zip -r9X R-@value{VERSIONno}.zip R-@value{VERSIONno}  # or something similar
@end example

We have not found a reliable way to convert base to lazy-loading when
cross-building, so it is left in the old format.

expand the @R{} sources and configure @R{} appropriately, for example

@example

cd R-@value{VERSIONno}

second line of options is also default on Mac OS X, but needed only if
you want to build @R{} for use with @code{R.app} Console, and imply
@option{--enable-R-shlib} to build @R{} as a shared/dynamic library.

These options configure @R{} to be built and installed as a framework
called @file{R.framework}.  The default path for @file{R.framework} is
@file{/Library/Frameworks} but this can be changed at configure time
specifying the flag @option{--enable-R-framework[=DIR]} or at install

@noindent
the @file{R.framework} has not to be specified in the path.

@node Running R, Add-on packages, Installing R under Mac OS X, Top
@chapter Running R

How to start @R{} and what command-line options are available is discussed
in @ref{Invoking R, , Invoking R, R-intro, An Introduction to R}.

@R{} makes use of a number of environment variables, the default values
of many of which are set in file @file{R_HOME/etc/Renviron} (there are
none set by default on Windows and hence no such file).  These are set
at @command{configure} time, and you would not normally want to change
them -- a possible exception is @env{R_PAPERSIZE} (@pxref{Setting paper
size}).

Various environment variables can be set to determine where @R{} creates
its per-session temporary directory.  The environment variables
@env{TMPDIR}, @env{TMP} and @env{TEMP} are searched in turn and the
first one which is set and points to a writable area is used.  If none
do, the final default is @file{/tmp} on Unix-alikes and the value of
@env{R_USER} on Windows.

Some systems are set up to remove files and directories periodically
from @file{/tmp}, for example by a @command{cron} job running
@command{tmpwatch}.  Set @env{TMPDIR} to another directory before
running long-running jobs on such a system.

It is helpful to use the correct terminology.  A @emph{package} is
loaded from a @emph{library} by the function @code{library()}.  Thus a
library is a directory containing installed packages; the main library
is @file{@var{R_HOME}/library}, but others can be used, for example by
setting the environment variable @env{R_LIBS} or using the @R{} function
@code{.libPaths()}.

@node Installing packages, Updating packages, Add-on packages, Add-on packages
@section Installing packages
@cindex Packages, installing

Packages may be distributed in source form or compiled binary form.
Installing source packages requires that compilers and tools (including
Perl 5.004 or later) be installed.  Binary packages are platform
specific and generally need no special tools to install, but see the
documentation for your platform for details.

Note that you need to specify implicitly or explicitly the library to
which the package is to be installed.  This is only an issue if you have
more than one library, of course.

To install packages from source in Unix use

@example
R CMD INSTALL -l /path/to/library @var{pkg1} @var{pkg2} @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
The part @samp{-l /path/to/library} can be omitted, in which case the
first library in @env{R_LIBS} is used if set, otherwise the main library
@file{@var{R_HOME}/library} is used.  (@env{R_LIBS} is looked for in the
environment: note that @file{.Renviron} is not read by @command{R CMD}.)
Ensure that the environment variable @env{TMPDIR} is either unset (and
@file{/tmp} exists and can be written in and executed from) or points to
a valid temporary directory.

There are a number of options available: use @code{R CMD INSTALL --help}
to see the current list.

The same command works in Windows if you have the source-code package
files (option ``Source Package Installation Files'' in the installer)
and toolset (see @ref{The Windows toolset}) installed.

@findex install.packages
Alternatively, packages can be downloaded and installed from within
@R{}.  First set the option @code{CRAN} to your nearest @acronym{CRAN}
mirror using @command{choooseCRANmirror()}.  Then download
and install packages @pkg{pkg1} and @pkg{pkg2} by

@example
> install.packages(c("pkg1", "pkg2"))
@end example

@noindent
Unless the library is specified (argument @code{lib}) the first library
in the library search path is used.  If you want to fetch a package and
all those it depends on that are not already installed, use e.g.

@example
> install.packages("Rcmdr", dependencies = TRUE)
@end example


What @code{install.packages} does by default is different on Unix and
Windows.  On Unix-alikes (include MacOS X unless running from the GUI
console) it consults the list of available @emph{source} packages on
@acronym{CRAN} (or other repository/ies), downloads the latest version
of the package sources, and installs them (via @code{R CMD INSTALL}).
On Windows it looks (by default) at the list of @emph{binary} versions
of packages available for your version of @R{} and downloads the latest
versions (if any), although optionally it will also download and install
a source package by setting the @code{type} argument.

@code{install.packages} can install a source package from a local
@file{.tar.gz} file by setting argument @code{repos} to @code{NULL}.

On Windows @code{install.packages} can also install a binary package
from a local @file{zip} file by setting argument @code{repos} to
@code{NULL}.   @code{Rgui.exe} has a menu @code{Packages} with a GUI
interface to @code{install.packages}, @code{update.packages} and
@code{library}.

@code{install.packages} can look in several repositories, specified as a
character vector by the argument @code{repos}: these can include a
@acronym{CRAN} mirror, Bioconductor, Omegahat, local archives, local
files, @dots{}).

On Mac OS X @code{install.packages} works as it does on other Unix-like
systems, but there is an additional type @code{mac.binary} that can be
passed to @code{install.package} in order to download and install binary
packages from @acronym{CRAN}. These Macintosh binary package files have
the extension @samp{tgz}.  The R GUI provides for installation of either
binary or source packages, from @acronym{CRAN} or local files.

@subsection Customizing compilation under Unix

The R system and package-specific compilation flags can be overridden or
added to by setting the appropriate Make variables in the personal file
@file{$HOME/.R/Makevars-$R_PLATFORM}, or if that does not exist,
@file{$HOME/.R/Makevars}, where @samp{R_PLATFORM} is the platform for
which R was built, as available in the @code{platform} component of the
R variable @code{R.version}.

Package developers are encouraged to use this mechanism to enable a
reasonable amount of diagnostic messaging (``warnings'') when compiling,
such as e.g.@: @option{-Wall -pedantic} for tools from GCC, the Gnu
Compiler Collection.

@findex MakeDll

@findex HELP
@findex HELPTYPES
@findex WINHELP

This section describes ways to customize package compilation using the
standard C / C++ / FORTRAN compilers and tools.  For instructions on using
non-standard tools, see the @file{README.packages} file.

The Makefiles can be customized: in particular the name of the DLL can
be set (for example we once needed @code{integrate-DLLNM=adapt}), the
compile flags can be set (see the examples in @file{MakeDll}) and the
types of help (if any) to be generated can be chosen (variables
@code{HELP}, @code{HELPTYPES} and @code{WINHELP}).  The simplest way to
customize the compilation steps is to set variables in a file
@file{src/Makevars.win}, which will automatically be included by
@file{MakeDLL}. For example, for RODBC @file{src/Makevars.win} could
include the line

@example
DLLLIBS+=-lodbc32
@end example

@noindent
or, equivalently,

@example
RODBC-DLLLIBS=-lodbc32
@end example

@noindent
but in fact contains the single line

@example
PKG_LIBS=-lodbc32
@end example

@noindent
If you have a file @file{src/Makefile.win}, that will be used as the
makefile for source compilation in place of our makefile and
@file{MakeDll} and @file{src/Makevars.win} will be ignored.

Package-specific compilation flags can be overridden or added to using
the personal file @file{$HOME/.R/Makevars.win}, or if that does not
exist, @file{$HOME/.R/Makevars}. (See the @file{rw-FAQ} for the meaning
of @code{$HOME}.)  For the record, the order of precedence is (last wins)
@itemize
@item
@file{MakeDll} and @file{MkRules}

@item
@file{src/Makefile}

@item
@file{src/Makevars.win} if it exists, otherwise @file{src/Makevars}

@item
@file{$HOME/.R/Makevars.win} if it exists, otherwise
@file{$HOME/.R/Makevars}.

@item
@file{src/Makefile.win} if present causes all of the above to be ignored.
@end itemize

@strong{Beware}: files @file{src/Makefile} or @file{src/Makevars} will
be used if they exist and the @file{.win} equivalents do not.  Such
files included in package sources are usually designed for use under
Unix and are best removed.

@strong{Beware}: references to variables in @file{R.dll} are converted to the
right form by using the header files.  You must include them.

For additional control, @file{@var{R_HOME}/src/gnuwin32/Makefile}
contains additional make targets corresponding to various options to
@code{R CMD INSTALL}.  These assume that package @code{foo}'s source
code has been installed in directory
@file{@var{R_HOME}/src/library/foo}. Then @code{make pkg-foo} is similar
to @code{R CMD INSTALL foo} (but the latter would require
@file{@var{R_HOME}/src/library} to be the current directory).  Other
targets are
@itemize
@item
@code{ziponly-foo}, to use zip to compress the help files after building
the package.
@item
@code{ziphelp-foo} to both compress the help files and to keep the
originals.
@item
@code{zipdata-foo} to compress the data files.  This is recommended if
you have either many small data files (as in package @pkg{Devore5}) or a
few large data files.
@item
@code{pkgcheck-foo} to check the package (like @code{R CMD CHECK foo}).
@end itemize

Using this approach allows variables to be set during the build, e.g.

@example
make PKGDIR=/mysources RLIB=/R/library pkg-foo
@end example

Some variables that may be used include:
@itemize
@item
@code{DEBUG=T} to compile with debugging information for @code{gdb}.
@item
@code{PKG_CFLAGS=} to specify options to the C compiler.
@item
@code{PKG_CPPFLAGS=} to specify options to the preprocessor.
@item

where the package should be installed.

can be a concatenation of the @file{DESCRIPTION} files of the packages
separated by blank lines (provided there are no bundles), but only a few
of the fields are needed.  The simplest way to set up such a file is to
use function @code{write_PACKAGES} in the @pkg{tools} package, and its

a @file{PACKAGES.gz} file, a @command{gzip}-compressed version of

@chapter Internationalization and Localization
@cindex Internationalization
@cindex Localization

@emph{Internationalization} refers to the process of enabling support
for non-English languages, and @emph{localization} to adapting to a
specific country and language.

@R{} has long worked in the ISO Latin-1 8-bit character set and so
covered English and most Western European languages (if not necessarily
their currency symbols).  What characters are valid in names was taken
from the current locale.  In general other locales with single-byte
encodings worked, but e.g. @code{postscript()} and @code{pdf()} needed
to be told about the encoding in use.

Full internationalization can be enabled when @R{} is built under
Unix-alikes by the (default) @command{configure} option
@option{--enable-mbcs}: @pxref{Configuration on Unix}.  Under Windows,
it is enabled by default in source builds, but support for `East Asian'
(Chinese/Japanese/Korean) languages is only enabled in the binary
install if it is selected in the installer.

All versions of @R{} support all single-byte character sets that the
underlying OS can handle.  These are interpreted according to the
@cindex Locale
current @code{locale}, a sufficiently complicated topic to merit a
separate section.  Fully internationalized versions can also handle most
multi-byte locales, in which a single character is represented by one,
two or more consecutive bytes: examples of such locales are those using
UTF-8 (becoming standard under Linux) and those for Chinese, Japanese
and Korean.  Note that only some of the graphics devices can handle
multi-byte or even non-Latin-1 character sets.

The other aspect of the internationalization is support of the
translation of messages.  This is enabled in almost all builds of @R{}
as from version 2.1.0.

@section Locales
@cindex Locale

A @emph{locale} is a description of the local environment of the user,
including the preferred language, the encoding of characters, the
currency used and its conventions, and so on.  Aspects of the locale are
accessed by the @R{} functions @code{Sys.getlocale} and
@code{Sys.localeconv}.

The system of naming locales is OS-specific.  There is quite wide
agreement on schemes, but not on the details of their implementation.  A
locale needs to specify
@itemize
@item
A human language.  These are generally specified by a lower-case two-character
abbreviation following ISO 639.

@item
A `territory', used mainly to specify the currency. These are generally
specified by an upper-case two-character abbreviation following ISO
3166.  Sometimes the combination of language and territory is used to
specify the encoding, for example to distinguish between traditional and
simplified Chinese.

@item
A charset encoding, which determines both how a byte stream should be
divided into characters, and which characters the subsequences of bytes
represent.

@item
Optionally, a modifier, for example to indicate that Austria is to be
considered pre- or post-Euro.
@end itemize

@R{} is principally concerned with the first (for translations) and
third.  Note that the charset may be deducible from the language, as
some OSes offer only one charset per language, and most OSes have only
one charset each for many languages.  Note too the remark above about
Chinese.

generally only see lists of languages/territories.

Internally Mac OS X uses a form similar to Linux but without specifying
the encoding (which is @code{.UTF-8}).


@node Localization of messages,  , Locales, Internationalization
@section Localization of messages

The preferred language for messages is by default taken from the locale.
This can be overridden first by the setting of the environment variable
@env{LANGUAGE} and then by the environment variables @env{LC_ALL},
@env{LC_MESSAGES} and @env{LANG}. (The last three are normally used to
set the locale and so should not be needed, but the first is only used
to select the language for messages.)  The code tries hard to map
locales to languages, but on some systems (notably Windows) the locale
names needed for the environment variable @env{LC_ALL} do not all
correspond to XPG language names and so @env{LANGUAGE} may need to be
set.  (One example is @samp{LC_ALL=es} on Windows which sets the locale
to Estonian and the language to Spanish.)

Note that you should not expect to be able to change the language once R
is running, and so @env{LC_MESSAGES} is not supported by
@code{Sys.setlocale}.

Messages are divided into @emph{domains}, and translations may be
available for some or all messages in a domain.  @R{} makes use of the
following domains.

@itemize
@item
Domain @code{R} for basic C-level error messages.

@item
Domain @code{R-@var{pkg}} for the R @code{stop}, @code{warning} and
@code{message} messages in each package, including @code{R-base} for the
@code{base} package.

@item
Domain @code{@var{pkg}} for the C-level messages in each package.

@item
Domain @code{RGui} for the menus etc of the R for Windows GUI front-end.

@end itemize

Dividing up the messages in this way allows @R{} to be extensible: as
packages are loaded, their message translation catalogues can be loaded
too.

Translations are looked for by domain according to the currently
specified language, as specifically as possible, so for example an
Austrian (@code{de_AT}) translation catalogue will be used in preference
to a generic German one (@code{de}) for an Austrian user.  However, if a
specific translation catalogue exists but does not contain a
translation, the less specific catalogues are consulted.  For example,
@R{} has catalogues for @code{en_GB} that translate the Americanisms
(e.g., @code{gray}) in the standard messages into English.

Translations in the right language but the wrong charset can generally
be made use of by on-the-fly re-encoding.  The @env{LANGUAGE} variable
(only) can be a colon-separated list, for example @code{se:de}, giving a
set of languages in decreasing order of preference.  One special value
is @code{en@@quot}, which can be used in a UTF-8 locale to have
English/American error messages with pairs of quotes translated to
Unicode directional quotes.

If no suitable translation catalogue is found or a particular message is
not translated in any suitable catalogue, English is used.

See @url{http://developer.r-project.org/Translations.html,
@code{developer.r-project.org/@/Translations.html}} for how to prepare
and install translation catalogues.

@chapter Choosing between 32- and 64-bit builds

@menu
* Windows::                     
@end menu

Many current CPUs have both 32- and 64-bit sets of instructions: this
has long been true for UltraSparc and more recently for MIPS, PPC and
@cputype{x86_64}.  Many OSes running on such CPUs offer the choice of
building a 32-bit or a 64-bit version of R (and details are given below
under specific OSes).  For most a 32-bit version is the default, but for
some (e.g., @cputype{x86_64}) 64-bit is.

All current versions of @R{} use 32-bit integers and
@acronym{IEC}@tie{}60559@footnote{also known as @acronym{IEC}@tie{}559 and
@acronym{IEEE}@tie{}754} double-precision reals, and so compute to the
same accuracy and with the same limits on the sizes of numerical
quantities.  The principal difference is in the size of the pointers.

64-bit builds have both advantages and disadvantages:
@itemize
@item
The total virtual memory space made available to a 32-bit
process@footnote{until recently this limit applied to all processes, not
just to one process} is limited to 4GB, and on most OSes to 3GB (or even
2GB).  The limits for 64-bit processes are much larger.

@R{} allocates memory for large objects as needed, and removes any
unused ones at garbage collection.  When the sizes of objects become an
appreciable fraction of the address limit, fragmentation of the address
space becomes an issue and there may be no hole available that is the
size requested.  This can cause more frequent garbage collection or the
inability to allocate large objects.  As a guide, this will become an
issue with objects more than 10% of the size of the address space
(around 300Mb) or when the total size of objects in use is around one
third (around 1Gb).

@item
32-bit OSes by default limit file sizes to 2GB.  This can often be
worked around: and @command{configure} selects suitable defines if this
is possible.  (We have also largely worked around that limit on
Windows.)  64-bit builds have much larger limits.

@item
Because the pointers are larger, @R{}'s basic structure (the cons cell)
is larger (normally twice the size).  This means that @R{} objects take
more space and more time to manipulate, especially during garbage
collection. So 64-bit versions of @R{} will typically run slower than
32-bit versions. (On Sparc Solaris the difference was 15-20%, on
@cputype{x86_64} around 10%.)

@end itemize

So, for speed you may want to use a 32-bit build, but to handle large
datasets (and perhaps large files) a 64-bit build.

Even on 64-bit builds of @R{} there are limits on the size of @R{}
objects (see @code{help("Memory-limits")}, some of which stem from the
use of 32-bit integers (especially in FORTRAN code).  On all versions of
@R{}, the maximum length (number of elements) of a vector is 2^31 -1,
about 2 billion, and on 64-bit systems the size of a block of memory
allocated is limited to 2^34 -1 bytes (8GB).  It is anticipated these
will be raised eventually but routine use of 8GB objects is (in 2005)
several years off.

@node Windows,  , Choosing between 32- and 64-bit builds, Choosing between 32- and 64-bit builds
@section Windows

Currently the Windows build of @R{} is a 32-bit executable.  This runs
happily on Windows 64 on AMD64 and EM64T, but is limited to a 3GB
address space.  It will not be possible to build a native version for
Windows 64 until suitable compilers are available, and currently
(mid-2005) that is not in prospect.

This appendix gives details of programs you will need to build @R{} on
Unix-like platforms, or which will be used by @R{} if found by
@command{configure}.

Remember that some package management systems (such as @acronym{RPM} and
deb) make a distinction between the user version of a package and the
development version.  The latter usually has the same name but with the
extension @samp{-devel} or @samp{-dev}: you need both versions
installed.

@node Essential programs, Useful libraries and programs, Essential and useful other programs in Unix, Essential and useful other programs in Unix
@section Essential programs

You need a means of compiling C and FORTRAN 77 (see @ref{Using
FORTRAN}).  Some add-on packages also need a C++ compiler.  Your C
compiler should be @acronym{IEC}@tie{}60059@footnote{also known as
@acronym{IEEE}@tie{}754}, POSIX 1003.1 and C99-compliant if at all
possible.  @R{} tries to choose suitable flags for the C compilers it
knows about, but you may have to set @code{CFLAGS} suitably.  For recent
versions of @command{gcc} with @code{glibc} this means including
@code{-std=gnu99} in @code{CFLAGS} (@code{-std=c99} excludes POSIX
functionality).

Unless you do not want to view graphs on-screen you need @samp{X11}
installed, including its headers and client libraries.  (On Fedora Core
Linux this means the @samp{xorg-x11-devel} and @samp{xorg-x11-libs}
RPMs, for example.  Older Linuxen used @samp{XFree86-}.  Some Debian
derivatives apparently also require @samp{libxt-dev}.)  If you really do
not want these you will need to explicitly configure @R{} without X11,
using @option{--with-x=no}.

The command-line editing depends on the @code{readline} library
available from any @acronym{GNU} mirror: you will need a fairly recent
version.  Otherwise you will need to configure with
@option{--with-readline=no} (or equivalent).

You will need Perl version 5.004 or later, available via
@url{http://www.perl.com/CPAN/, @code{www.perl.com/CPAN}}, to build any
of the on-line documentation.

You will not be able to build the info files unless you have
@command{makeinfo} version 4.7 or later installed, and if not some of
the @HTML{} manuals will be linked to @acronym{CRAN}.  (Version 4.6 is
known to create incorrect @HTML{} files.)

@cindex Vignettes
The typeset documentation and building vignettes needs @command{tex} and
@command{latex}, or @command{pdftex} and @command{pdflatex}.

If you want to build from the R Subversion repository you need Perl,
@command{makeinfo} and @command{pdflatex}.
@cindex Subversion


@node Useful libraries and programs,  , Essential programs, Essential and useful other programs in Unix
@section Useful libraries and programs

The use of multi-byte characters, conversion between encodings and the
@R{} @code{iconv} function depend on having the system @code{iconv}
function: this is part of recent versions of @code{glibc} and many
Unixes.  You can also install @acronym{GNU} @code{libiconv} (which is
not the same as that in @code{glibc}), possibly as a plug-in
replacement: see @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/,
@code{www.gnu.org/software/libiconv}}.  Note that the @R{} usage
requires @code{iconv} to be able to translate between @code{"latin1"}
and @code{"UTF-8"}, to recognize @code{""} as the current encoding and
to translate to and from the Unicode wide-character formats
@code{"UCS-[24][BL]E"} -- this is not true of most commercial Unixes.

The ability to use translated messages makes use of @code{gettext} and
most likely needs @acronym{GNU} @code{gettext}: you do need this to
work with new translations, but otherwise that contained in the R
sources will be used if no suitable external @code{gettext} is found.

The bitmapped graphics devices @code{jpeg()} and @code{png()} need the
appropriate headers and libraries installed: @code{jpeg} (version 6b
or later) or @code{libpng} (version 1.2.3 or later) and @code{zlib}
(version 1.1.3 or later) respectively.

The @code{bitmap} and @code{dev2bitmap} devices use ghostscript
(@url{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost, @code{www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost}}).

If you have them installed (including the appropriate headers and of
recent enough versions), @code{zlib}, @code{libbz2} and PCRE will be
used if specified by @option{--with-system-zlib},
@option{--with-system-bzlib} or @option{--with-system-pcre}: otherwise
versions in the @R{} sources will be compiled in.  As the latter suffice
and are tested with @R{} you should not need to change this.  In
particular, the version of @code{zlib} 1.2.3 in the @R{} sources has
enhancements to work with large file systems on 32-bit platforms.

@cindex BLAS library

The linear algebra routines in @R{} can make use of enhanced BLAS (Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms, @url{http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html,
@code{www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html}}) routines.  Some are
compiler-system-specific (@code{libsunperf} on Sun Sparc@footnote{Using
the SunPro aka Forte aka Sun ONE @command{cc} and @command{f95}
compilers}, @code{libessl} on IBM, @code{vecLib} on Mac OS X) but ATLAS
(@url{http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/,
@code{math-atlas.sourceforge.net}}) is a ``tuned'' BLAS that runs on a
wide range of Unix-alike platforms.  If no more specific library is
found, a @code{libblas} library in the library path will be used.  You
can specify a particular BLAS library @emph{via} a value for the
configuration option @option{--with-blas} and not to use an external
BLAS library by @option{--without-blas}.  (Alternatively, the
environment variable @env{BLAS_LIBS} can be set, for example in
@file{config.site}.)

For systems with multiple processors it is possible to use a
multi-threaded version of ATLAS.  An issue is that @R{} profiling, which
uses the @code{SIGPROF} signal, may cause problems, and you may want to
disable profiling if you use a multi-threaded version of ATLAS.  You can
use a multi-threaded ATLAS by specifying

@example
--with-blas="-lptf77blas -lpthread -latlas"
@end example

Users of Fedora Core 4 Extras will want to use
@example
--with-blas="-latlas -lf77blas -llapack_atlas" --with-lapack
@end example

@noindent
since the basic BLAS is incomplete.

Another tuned BLAS which is available for some processors under Linux is
by Kazushige Goto, currently available @emph{for academic use only}
(after registering) via@*
@url{http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/resources/software/software.php}.@*
(Recent versions are multi-threaded only.)  Once this is installed, it
can be used by configuring with

@example
--with-blas="-lgoto -lpthread"
@end example

@noindent
It has been reported that on some RedHat-based Linux systems it is
necessary to set @code{OMP_NUM_THREADS=1} (to disable multiple threads)
in the environment when using a multi-threaded Goto BLAS, but others run
happily with multiple threads.  That environment variable should be set
when using @R{} profiling.

For Intel processors under Linux, Intel's Math Kernel Library
(@url{http://www.intel.com/software/products/mkl/,
@code{www.intel.com/@/software/@/products/@/mkl}}) can be used
by

@example
--with-blas="-lmkl -lguide -lpthread"
@end example

@noindent
with the same caveat on multi-threading (but the number of threads
defaults to 1).  (Thanks to Andy Liaw for the information.)

For @cputype{x86_64} and @cputype{ix86} processors under Linux there is
the AMD Core Math Library (ACML) @url{http://www.amd.com/acml,
@code{www.amd.com/acml}}.  For the @command{gcc} version (which is
single-threaded only) we could use

@example
--with-blas="-lacml"
@end example

@noindent
if the appropriate library directory such as
@file{/opt/acml2.7.0/gnu64/lib} is in the @env{LD_LIBRRARY_PATH}.  For
other compilers, see the ACML documentation.  Although the documentation
is unclear, 32-bit versions of ACML do run on other @cputype{ia32} chips
such as AthlonMP and P4.

Note that the BLAS library will be used for several add-on packages as
well as for @R{} itself.  This means that it is better to use a
shared/dynamic BLAS library, as most of a static library will be
compiled into the @R{} executable and each BLAS-using package.  In any
case, the BLAS library must be usable with dynamically-loadable code:
this can be a problem with ATLAS on some platforms (including
@cputype{x86_64}) as it is not by default built with
position-independent code.

You will need double-precision and double-complex versions of the BLAS,
but not single-precision nor complex routines.  This is checked by
@command{configure}, as some incomplete BLAS libraries have been found
(e.g., the generic BLAS supplied with Fedora Core 3 and 4 Extras is
missing @code{drotm}, @code{drotmg} and @code{zdrot}).

On some systems it is necessary that an external BLAS was built with the
same FORTRAN compiler used to build @R{}: known problems are with @R{}
built with @command{gfortran}  @pxref{Using gfortran}.


@cindex LAPACK library
Provision is made for using an external LAPACK library, principally to
cope with BLAS libraries which contain a copy of LAPACK (such as
@code{libsunperf} on Solaris, @code{vecLib} on Mac OS X and ACML on
@cputype{ix86}/@cputype{x86_64} Linux).  However, the likely performance
gains are thought to be small (and may be negative), and the default is
not to search for a suitable LAPACK library, this is definitely
@strong{not} recommended.  You can specify a specific LAPACK library or
a search for a generic library by the configuration option
@option{--with-lapack}.  The default for @option{--with-lapack} is to
check the BLAS library and then look for an external library
@code{-llapack}.  Sites searching for the fastest possible linear
algebra may want to build a LAPACK library using the ATLAS-optimized
subset of LAPACK.  To do so specify something like

@example
--with-lapack="-L/path/to/libs -llapack -lcblas"
@end example

@noindent
since the ATLAS subset of LAPACK depends on @code{libcblas}.  A value
for @option{--with-lapack} can be set @emph{via} the environment variable
@env{LAPACK_LIBS}, but this will only be used if @option{--with-lapack}
is specified (as the default value is @code{no}) and the BLAS library
does not contain LAPACK.

Since ACML contains a full LAPACK, if selected as the BLAS it can be
used as the LAPACK @emph{via} @option{--with-lapack}.

Intel's Math Kernel Library suppies a full LAPACK which can be used via
@example
--with-lapack="-L/path/to/libs -lmkl_lapack64"
@end example

@noindent
or @code{-lmkl_lapack32}: @code{-lmkl_lapack} is static and not PIC.
However, the version 8.0.1.006 we tested failed a regression test in the
complex LAPACK.

If you do use @option{--with-lapack}, be aware of potential problems
with bugs in the LAPACK 3.0 sources (or in the posted corrections to those
sources).  In particular, bugs in @code{DGEEV} and @code{DGESDD} have
resulted in error messages such as

@example
DGEBRD gave error code -10
@end example

@noindent
(seen with the Debian @code{-llapack} which was current in late 2002,
Fedora Core 4 Extras @code{-llapack} in September 2005 and 64-bit
@code{libsunperf} in Forte 7).  Other potential problems are incomplete
versions of the libraries: for example @code{libsunperf} from Sun Forte
6.x was missing the entry point for @code{DLANGE} and @code{vecLib} has
omitted the BLAS routine @code{LSAME}.  For problems compiling LAPACK
using recent versions of @samp{gcc} on @cputype{ix86} Linux, see
@ref{New platforms}: these problems have surfaced in Fedora Core 3's
distribution, for example.

Please @strong{do} bear in mind that using @option{--with-lapack} is
`definitely @strong{not} recommended': it is provided @strong{only}
because it is necessary on some platforms.

As with all libraries, you need to ensure that they and @R{} were
compiled with compatible compilers and flags.  For example, this means
that on Sun Sparc using the native compilers the flag @option{-dalign}
is needed so @code{libsunperf} can be used.

An ATLAS `tuned' BLAS can also be used on Windows: see @pxref{Getting the
source files} when building from source, and
@url{http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/rw-FAQ.html, R Windows
@acronym{FAQ}} for adding pre-compiled support to binary versions.
Other BLASs can also be used when building from source.

Note that under Unix (but not under Windows) if @R{} is compiled
against a non-default BLAS, then all BLAS-using packages must also be.
So if @R{} is re-built after ATLAS is installed, then packages such as
@pkg{quantreg} will need to be re-installed.

@end table

@noindent
You can use @option{--without-foo} or @option{--disable-foo} for the
negatives.

You will want to use @option{--disable-R-profiling} if you are building
a profiled executable of @R{} (e.g.@: with @samp{-pg)}.

Flag @option{--enable-R-shlib} causes the make process to build @R{} as
a dynamic (shared) library, typically called @file{libR.so}, and link
the main @R{} executable @file{R.bin} against that library.  This can
only be done if all the code (including system libraries) can be
compiled into a dynamic library, and there may be a
performance@footnote{We have measured 15--20% on i686 Linux and around
10% on @cputype{x86_64} Linux.} penalty.  So you probably only want
this if you will be using an application which embeds @R{}.  Note that C
code in packages installed on a @R{} system linked with
@option{--enable-R-shlib} are linked against the dynamic library and so
such packages cannot be used from a @R{} system built in the default
way.


@node Internationalization support, Configuration variables, Configuration options, Configuration on Unix
@section Internationalization support

@R{} supports multi-byte character sets (@acronym{MBCS}), in particular
for UTF-8 locales (which are usually identified by suffix @code{.utf8},
something like @code{en_GB.utf8}@footnote{AIX has to be different: it
has @code{EN_US.UTF-8}!}.  UTF-8 is an encoding of Unicode and in
principle covers all human languages simultaneously: however, a given
system may not have fonts capable of displaying more than a few of these
languages.

Support for UTF-8 is selected at @command{configure} time (unless
disabled with @option{--disable-mbcs}).  This will check for a large
number of features, notably support for the C99/UNIX98 wide character
functions, for UTF-8 or MBCS support in X11 and for @command{iconv} with
a rich enough functionality.  If enough of these are found, @code{MBCS}
will be listed as one of the ``Additional capabilities''.  Then if @R{}
is started in a UTF-8 locale it assumes that the terminal will supply
and display UTF-8-encoded characters@footnote{You may have to set this
with @code{luit}, but it should be the default in a window manager
session started in UTF-8.}.  If run in a single-byte locale, @R{}
behaves almost exactly as if it was configured with
@option{--disable-mbcs}.

A version of @R{} with MBCS support can also be run in other multi-byte
locales, for example those using the EUC-JP, EUC-KR and EUC-TW encodings
on Unix-alikes and the code pages for Chinese, Japanese and Korean on
Windows.

Translation of messages is supported via GNU @code{gettext} unless
disabled by the configure option @option{--disable-nls} or the
underlying OS has insufficiently standard C functions to support it.
The @code{configure} report will show @code{NLS} as one of the 
`Additional capabilities' if support has been compiled in, and running
in an English locale (but not the @code{C} locale) will include

@example
  Natural language support but running in an English locale
@end example

@noindent
in the greeting on starting R.


@node Configuration variables, Using make, Internationalization support, Configuration on Unix
@section Configuration variables

@findex configure
If you need or want to set certain configure variables to something
other than their default, you can do that by either editing the file
@file{config.site} (which documents all the variables you might want to
set) or on the command line as

@example
./configure VAR=@var{value}
@end example

@noindent
If you are building in a directory different from the sources, there can
be copies of @file{config.site} in the source and the build directories,
and both will be read (in that order).  To force a single file to be
read, set the environment variable @env{CONFIG_SITE} to the location of
the file.

These variables are @emph{precious}, implying that they do not have to
be exported to the environment, are kept in the cache even if not
specified on the command line and checked for consistency between two
configure runs (provided that caching is used), and are kept during
automatic reconfiguration as if having been passed as command line
arguments, even if no cache is used.

See the variable output section of @code{configure --help} for a list of
all these variables.

If you find you need to alter configure variables, it is worth noting
that some settings may be cached in the file @file{config.cache}, and it
is a good idea to remove that file (if it exists) before re-configuring.
Note that caching is turned @emph{off} by default: use the command line
option @option{--config-cache} (or @option{-C}) to enable caching.

@node Compilation flags, Making manuals, Setting the browser, Configuration variables
@subsection Compilation flags

If you have libraries and header files, e.g., for @acronym{GNU}
readline, in non-system directories, use the variables @code{LDFLAGS}
(for libraries, using @samp{-L} flags to be passed to the linker) and
@code{CPPFLAGS} (for header files, using @samp{-I} flags to be passed to
the C/C++ preprocessors), respectively, to specify these locations.
These default to @code{LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib}
(@code{/usr/local/lib64} on most 64-bit Linux OSes) and
@code{CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include} to catch the most common cases.  If
libraries are still not found, then maybe your compiler/linker does not
support re-ordering of @option{-L} and @option{-l} flags (this has been
reported to be a problem on HP-UX with the native @command{cc}).  In
this case, use a different compiler (or a front end shell script which
does the re-ordering).

@node Using make, Using FORTRAN, Configuration variables, Configuration on Unix
@section Using make
@findex make

To compile @R{}, you will most likely find it easiest to use GNU
@command{make}.  On Solaris 2.6/7/8 in particular, you need a version of
@acronym{GNU} @command{make} different from 3.77; 3.79.1 works fine, as
does the Sun @command{make}.  The native @command{make} is reported to
fail on SGI Irix 6.5 and Alpha/OSF1 (aka Tru64).

To build in a separate directory you need a @command{make} that uses the
@code{VPATH} variable, for example @acronym{GNU} @command{make}, or Sun
@command{make} on Solaris 2.7/8/9 (but not earlier).

If you want to use a @command{make} by another name, for example if your
@acronym{GNU} @command{make} is called @samp{gmake}, you need to set the
variable @code{MAKE} at configure time, for example

@findex configure

@section Using FORTRAN

To compile @R{}, you need a FORTRAN compiler.  The default
is to search for
@c F95_compilers in m4/R.m4:
@command{f95}, @command{fort}, @command{xlf95},
@command{ifort}, @command{ifc}, @command{efc}, @command{pgf95}
@command{lf95}, @command{gfortran}, @command{ftn}, @command{g95},
@c F90 compilers in m4/R.m4:
@command{f90}, @command{xlf90}, @command{pghpf}, @command{pgf90},
@command{epcf90},
@c F77 compilers in m4/R.m4:
@command{g77}, @command{f77}, @command{xlf}, @command{frt},
@command{pgf77}, @command{cf77}, @command{fort77}, @command{fl32},
@command{af77} (in that order)@footnote{On HP-UX @command{fort77} is the
@acronym{POSIX} compliant FORTRAN compiler, and comes after
@command{g77}.}, and use whichever is found first; if none is found,
@R{} cannot be compiled.
@c GCC_Fortran_compiler in m4/R.m4:
However, if @command{CC} is @command{gcc}, the matching FORTRAN compiler
(@command{g77} for @command{gcc}@tie{}3 and @code{gfortran} for
@command{gcc}@tie{}4) is used if available.

The search mechanism can be changed using the configure variable
@code{F77} which specifies the command that runs the FORTRAN 77
compiler.  If your FORTRAN compiler is in a non-standard location, you
should set the environment variable @env{PATH} accordingly before
running @command{configure}, or use the configure variable @code{F77} to
specify its full path.

If your FORTRAN libraries are in slightly peculiar places, you should
also look at @env{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} or your system's equivalent to make
sure that all libraries are on this path.

Note that only FORTRAN compilers which convert identifiers to lower case
are supported.

You must set whatever compilation flags (if any) are needed to ensure
that FORTRAN @code{integer} is equivalent to a C @code{int} pointer and
FORTRAN @code{double precision} is equivalent to a C @code{double}
pointer.  This is checked during the configuration process.

Some of the FORTRAN code makes use of @code{COMPLEX*16} variables, which
is a FORTRAN 90 extension.  This is checked for at configure
time@footnote{as well as its equivalence to the @code{Rcomplex}
structure defined in @file{R_ext/Complex.h}.}, but you may need to avoid
compiler flags@footnote{In particular, avoid @command{g77}'s
@option{-pedantic}, which gives confusing error messages.} asserting
FORTRAN 77 compliance.

@cindex BLAS library
For performance reasons@footnote{e.g., to use an optimized BLAS on
Sun/Sparc} you may want to choose a FORTRAN 90/95 compiler.

It is possible to use @command{f2c}, the FORTRAN-to-C converter
(@url{http://www.netlib.org/f2c, @code{www.netlib.org/f2c}}), via a
script.  (An example script is given in @file{scripts/f77_f2c}: this can
be customized by setting the environment variables @env{F2C},
@env{F2CLIBS}, @env{CC} and @env{CPP}.)  You may need to ensure that the
FORTRAN type @code{integer} is translated to the C type @code{int}.
Normally @file{f2c.h} contains @samp{typedef long int integer;}, which
will work on a 32-bit platform but not on a 64-bit platform.  If your
compiler is not @command{gcc} you will need to set @env{FPICFLAGS}
appropriately.


@node Using gfortran,  , Using FORTRAN, Using FORTRAN
@subsection Using gfortran

@command{gfortran} is the F95 compiler that is part of
@command{gcc}@tie{}4.x.y.

There was a problem with the version in the @command{gcc}@tie{}4.0.0
release and most pre-releases.  At least on @cputype{ix86} and
@cputype{x86_64} Linux and MacOS X the dynamic version of the FORTRAN
runtime @code{libgfortran} could not be used: if this is loaded
redirection of C @file{stdin} (which @R{} uses in many of its scripts)
becomes non-functional.  A workaround is to set the environment variable
@env{GFORTRAN_STDIN_UNIT} to @code{-1}, but versions before 10 April
2005 had another bug causing the setting to be ignored.  Both problems
have been fixed for @command{gcc}@tie{}4.0.1.  The version of
@command{gfortran} shipping with Fedora Core 4 seems to have the fixes
in place.

Some versions of @command{g95} (from @url{http://www.g95.org,
@code{www.g95.org}}) have the same problem.

On @code{x86_64} systems there is an incompatibility in the return
conventions for double-complex functions between @command{gfortran} and
@command{g77} which results in the final example in @code{example(eigen)}
hanging or segfaulting under external BLASs built under @command{g77},
as well as with Dr Goto's BLAS.  As from @R{} 2.2.0 this should be
detected by a @command{configure} test.

@noindent
Library paths specified as @option{-L/lib/path} in @code{LDFLAGS} are
collected together and prepended to @env{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} (or your
system's equivalent), so there should be no need for @option{-R} or
@option{-rpath} flags.

Variables such as @env{CPICFLAGS} are determined where possible by
@command{configure}.  Some systems allows two types of PIC flags, for
example @samp{-fpic} and @samp{-fPIC}, and if they differ the first
allows only a limited number of symbols in a shared library.  Since @R{}
as a shared library has about 6200 symbols, if in doubt use the larger
version.

To compile a profiling version of @R{}, one might for example want to
use @samp{MAIN_CFLAGS=-pg}, @samp{MAIN_FFLAGS=-pg},
@samp{MAIN_LDFLAGS=-pg} on platforms where @samp{-pg} cannot be used
with position-independent code.

@strong{Beware}: it may be necessary to set @code{CFLAGS} and
@code{FFLAGS} in ways compatible with the libraries to be used: one
possible issue is the alignment of doubles, another is the way
structures are passed.

On some platforms @command{configure} will select additional flags for
@code{CFLAGS}, @code{CPPFLAGS}, @code{FFLAGS}, @code{CXXFLAGS} and
@code{LIBS} in @code{R_XTRA_CFLAGS} (and so on).  These are for options
which are always required, for example to force @acronym{IEC}@tie{}60559
compliance.

This section provides some notes on building @R{} on different Unix-like
platforms.  These notes are based on tests run on one or two systems in
each case with particular sets of compilers and support libraries.
Success in building @R{} depends on the proper installation and functioning
of support software; your results may differ if you have other versions
of compilers and support libraries.

@section Linux
@cindex Linux

Linux is the main development platform for @R{}, so compilation from the
sources is normally straightforward with the standard compilers.

Remember that some package management systems (such as @acronym{RPM} and
deb) make a distinction between the user version of a package and the
developer version.  The latter usually has the same name but with the
extension @samp{-devel} or @samp{-dev}: you need both versions
installed.  So please check the @code{configure} output to see if the
expected features are detected: if for example @samp{readline} is
missing add the developer package.  (On most systems you will also need
@samp{ncurses} and its developer package, although these should be
dependencies of the @samp{readline} package(s).)

When @R{} has been installed from a binary distribution there are
sometimes problems with missing components such as the FORTRAN
compiler.  Searching the @samp{R-help} archives will normally reveal
what is needed.

It seems that @cputype{ix86} Linux accepts non-PIC code in shared
libraries, but this is not necessarily do so on other platforms, in
particular for 64-bit CPUs such as that for AMD Opteron.  So care can be
needed with BLAS libraries and when building @R{} as a shared library to
ensure that position-independent code is used in any static libraries
(such as the Tcl/Tk libraries, @code{libpng}, @code{libjpeg} and
@code{zlib}) which might be linked against.  Fortunately these are
normally built as shared libraries with the exception of the ATLAS BLAS
libraries.

For platforms with both 64- and 32-bit support, it is likely that

@example
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib64 -L/usr/local/lib"
@end example

@noindent
is appropriate since most (but not all) software installs its 64-bit
libraries in @file{/usr/local/lib64}.  To build a 32-bit version of @R{}
on @cputype{x86_64} we used

@example
CFLAGS="-m32 -O2 -g -Wall -pedantic -std=gnu99" 
CXXFLAGS="-m32 -O2 -g" 
FFLAGS="-m32 -O2 -g"
LDFLAGS=-m32
LIBnn=lib
--x-libraries=/usr/X11R6/lib
@end example

@noindent
and had to build @code{readline} ourselves as Fedora Core 3 only shipped
a 64-bit version.

64-bit versions of Linux are built with support for files > 2Gb, and
32-bit versions will be if possible unless @option{--disable-largefile}
is specified.

@R{} used to include the compiler flag @option{-mieee-fp}, but it seems
this was really an alias for the linker flag @option{-lieee}.  Neither
are needed for a modern Linux (e.g.@: using @code{glibc} 2.2 or 2.3) but
could conceivably be needed on an older version.  @code{glibc} 2.1
required @option{-D__NO_MATH_INLINES} to achieve
@acronym{IEC}@tie{}60059-compliance for @code{exp}, and this is included in
@code{R_XTRA_CFLAGS} if required.

Several Linux distributions have shipped unreleased versions of
@command{gcc}@tie{}4.0.0 and its FORTRAN compiler @command{gfortran}
(see the separate comments).  Some versions of @command{gcc}@tie{}4
(such as that in Fedora Core 3) produce incorrect code.  In our
experiments @command{gcc}@tie{}3.4.x always produced faster and more
reliable code.  It seems that @command{gcc}@tie{}4.0.1 and
@command{gcc}@tie{}4.0.2 cannot compile @file{src/main/plot.c} when
building R as a shared library on @cputype{ix86} unless the optimization
level is changed from the default @option{-O2} (@option{-O3} works).

Intel compilers have been used under @cputype{ix86} and @cputype{x86_64}
Linux and @R{} contains code to set the FPU options suitably.  Brian
Ripley tried version 9.0 of the compilers for @cputype{ix86} @emph{via}

@example
CC=icc
F77=ifort
CXX=icc
ICC_LIBS=/opt/compilers/intel/cc/9.0/lib
IFC_LIBS=/opt/compilers/intel/fc/9.0/lib
LDFLAGS="-L$ICC_LIBS -L$IFC_LIBS -L/usr/local/lib"
@end example

@noindent
and adding optimization flags failed: at least @file{src/@/main/@/regex.c}
and @file{src/@/modules/@/lapack/@/dlamc.f} need to be compiled without
optimization.  For @cputype{x86_64} he used

@example
CC=icc
CFLAGS="-g -O2 -wd188"
F77=ifort
CXX=icc
ICC_LIBS=/opt/compilers/intel/cce/9.0/lib
IFC_LIBS=/opt/compilers/intel/fce/9.0/lib
LDFLAGS="-L$ICC_LIBS -L$IFC_LIBS -L/usr/local/lib"
@end example

@noindent
@R{} will add @code{-mp} in @code{R_XTRA_@{C,F,CXX@}FLAGS} to maintain
correct @acronym{IEC}@tie{}60559 arithmetic.  The flag @option{-wd188}
suppresses a large number of warnings about the enumeration type
@samp{Rboolean}.  Because the Intel C compiler sets @samp{__GNUC__}
without complete emulation of @command{gcc}, we suggest adding
@code{CPPFLAG=-no-gcc}.

For some comments on building on an Itanium (@samp{ia64}) Linux system
with @command{gcc} or the Intel compilers see
@url{http://www.nakama.ne.jp/memo/ia64_linux/,
@code{www.nakama.ne.jp/memo/ia64_linux}}.

Jennifer Lai used the Portland Group compilers on @cputype{x86_64} to
build pre-2.2.0.  Updated versions of the settings she used are

@example
PG_HOME=/usr/pgi/linux86-64/6.0
CC=pgcc
CFLAGS="-g -O2"
CPPFLAGS="-I$PG_HOME/include -I$PG_HOME/include/CC"
F77=pgf77
FFLAGS=-O2
CXX=pgCC
FC=pgf95
FCFLAGS=-O2
SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS=-shared
SHLIB_LDFLAGS=-shared
LDFLAGS="-L$PG_HOME/libso -L/usr/lib64"
@end example

@noindent
Note particularly the last, which is needed to ensure that a shared
version of @code{libc} is found.  As from @R{} 2.2.1, we include
@code{-mieee-fp} in @code{R_XTRA_CFLAGS} so it should not be included in
@code{CFLAGS}.

You can build @R{} as a Unix application on Mac OS X using the Apple
Developer Tools and @command{g77} or @command{gfortran}.  You will also
need to install an X sub-system or configure with
@option{--without-x}. The X window manager is part of the standard Mac

For more information on how to find these tools please read the
@url{http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html, R for Mac
OS X @acronym{FAQ}}.

If you use the X window manager and prefer @code{Terminal.app} to
@code{xterm}, you should be aware that @R{}, like many Unix tools, uses
the existence of a @env{DISPLAY} environment variable to determine
whether an X system is running.  This affects the default graphics
device for the commmand-line version of R and the behaviour of the
@code{png()} and @code{jpeg} devices.

@node Solaris, HP-UX, Mac OS X, Platform notes
@section Solaris on Sparc
@cindex Solaris

@R{} has been built successfully on Sparc Solaris 8 aka Solaris 2.8 aka
SunOS 5.8 using @command{gcc}@tie{}3/@command{g77},
@command{gcc}@tie{}4/@command{gfortran} and the `Sun ONE Studio 7
Compiler Suite' (aka Forte@tie{}7), and less regularly on Solaris@tie{}9
and 10.  @acronym{GNU} @command{make} was needed prior to
Solaris@tie{}2.7 for building other than in the source tree, and is
sometimes needed to establish the correct dependencies when rebuilding.

The Solaris versions of several of the tools needed to build @R{}
(e.g.@: @command{make}, @command{ar} and @command{ld}) are in
@file{/usr/ccs/bin}, so if using those tools ensure this is in your
path.

@command{gcc} 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 generate incorrect code on 32-bit Solaris
builds with optimization, but versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.2.3 and later work
correctly.  (@code{make check} fails at the first attempt to plot.)

If using @command{gcc}, do ensure that the compiler was compiled for the
version of Solaris in use.  (This can be ascertained from @command{gcc
-v}.)  @command{gcc} makes modified versions of some header files, and
so (for example) @command{gcc} compiled under Solaris 2.6 will not
compile @R{} under Solaris 2.7.  Also, do ensure that it was compiled
for the assembler/loader in use: if you download @command{gcc} from
@url{http://www.sunfreeware.com, @code{www.sunfreeware.com}} then you
need to download @code{binutils} too.  To avoid all these pitfalls we
strongly recommended you compile @command{gcc} from the sources
yourself.

It was reported by Mike Pacey that Sun Forte 9 requires
@code{-xopenmp=stubs} added to @code{LDFLAGS}.

When using the SunPro compilers do @emph{not} specify @option{-fast}, as
this disables @acronym{IEEE} arithmetic and @command{make check} will
fail.  The maximal set of optimization options known to work on Sparc is

@example
-xlibmil -xO5 -dalign -xc99
@end example

@noindent
(@cputype{x86} versions do not need @samp{-dalign}, and some do not
support it.)

We have found little performance difference between @command{gcc} and
@command{cc} but considerable benefit from using a SunPro FORTRAN
compiler: the @command{gcc}/@command{f77} combination works well.  For
many C++ applications Forte 7 requires @code{-lCstd}, which the
configure script will add to @code{SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS} if it identifies
the compiler correctly.

To compile for a 64-bit target on Sparc Solaris (which needs an
UltraSparc chip and for support to be enabled in the OS) with the Forte
7 compilers we used @option{--without-blas} and

@example
CC="cc -xarch=v9"
CFLAGS="-xO5 -xlibmil -dalign -xc99"
F77="f95 -xarch=v9"

For 64-bit compilation with @command{gcc} 3.2.x and later we used

@example
CC="gcc -m64"
F77="g77 -m64"
CXX="g++ -m64"
FC="gfortran -m64"
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib/sparcv9 -L/usr/local/lib"
@end example

@noindent
replacing @samp{g77} with @samp{gfortran} for @command{gcc} 4.0.x.
Note that @samp{/usr/local/lib/sparcv9} will need to be in the
@samp{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} during configuration.

Solaris on Sparc CPUs need @samp{PIC} and not @samp{pic} versions of
@env{CPICFLAGS} and @env{FPICFLAGS} since the @samp{pic} version only
allows 1024 symbols on a 64-bit build (and 2048 on a 32-bit build).


@cindex BLAS library
@cindex LAPACK library

Note that using @command{f95} allows the Sun performance library
@code{libsunperf} to be selected: it may not work@footnote{recent
versions have @command{f77} as a wrapper for @command{f95}, and these do
work.} with @command{f77}, and will not with @command{g77}.
@code{libsunperf} contains both BLAS and LAPACK code, and
@option{--with-lapack} may be required if you use it.  On our test system
using @code{libsunperf} failed for 64-bit builds with both Forte 6U1 and
7, albeit in different ways.  Our experience has been that ATLAS's BLAS
is faster than @code{libsunperf}, especially for complex numbers.

Some care is needed to ensure that libraries found by
@command{configure} are compatible with the @R{} executable and modules, as
the testing process will not detect many of the possible problems.  For
32-bit builds under @command{cc} the flag @option{-dalign} is needed for
some of the Sun libraries: fortunately the equivalent flag for
@command{gcc}, @option{-mno-unaligned-doubles}, is the default.  In
theory, libraries such as @code{libpng}, @code{libjpeg}, @code{zlib} and
the ATLAS libraries need to be built with a @code{pic} or @code{PIC}
flag, which could be a problem if static libraries are used.  In
practice this seems to give little problem for 32-bit builds, especially
as @cputype{ix86} Linux accepts non-PIC code in shared libraries.

For a 64-bit build, 64-bit libraries must be used.  As the configuration
process by default sets @code{LDFLAGS} to @samp{-L/usr/local/lib}, you
may need to set it to avoid finding 32-bit addons (as in the
@command{gcc -m64} example above).  It is possible to build Tcl/Tk as
64-bit libraries with the configure option @command{--enable-64bit}, but
only with the Forte compiler (and not with @command{gcc}) as of
Tcl/Tk@tie{}8.4.5.


@node HP-UX, IRIX, Solaris, Platform notes
@section HP-UX
@cindex HP-UX

The reports on HP-UX here predate @R{} 2.0.0.

@R{} has been built successfully on HP-UX 10.2 and HP-UX 11.0 using both
native compilers and @command{gcc}.  However, 10.2 has not been tested
since @R{} 1.4.0.  By default, @R{} is configured to use @command{gcc} and
@command{g77} on HP-UX (if available).  Some installations of
@command{g77} only install a static version of the @command{g2c} library
that cannot be linked into a shared library since its files have not
been compiled with the appropriate flag for producing position
independent code (@acronym{PIC}).  This will result in @command{make}
failing with a linker error similar to

@example
ld: CODE_ONE_SYM fixup to non-code subspace in file foo.o -
shared library must be position independent. Use +z or +Z to recompile.
@end example

@noindent
(@option{+z} and @option{+Z} are the @acronym{PIC} flags for the native
compiler @command{cc}.)  If this is the case you either need to modify
your @command{g77} installation or configure with

@example
F77=fort77
@end example

@noindent
to specify use of the native @acronym{POSIX}-compliant FORTRAN 77
compiler.

You may find that @command{configure} detects other libraries that R
needs to use as shared libraries but are only available as static
libraries.  If you cannot install shared versions you will need to tell
@command{configure} not to use these libraries, or make sure they are
not in the library path.  The symptom will be the linker error shown in
the last paragraph.  Static libraries that might be found and would
cause problems are

@example
BLAS                   @r{use @option{--without-blas}}
Tcl/Tk                 @r{use @option{--without-tcltk}}
libpng                 @r{use @option{--without-libpng}}
jpeg                   @r{use @option{--without-jpeglib}}
zlib                   @r{use @option{--without-system-zlib}}
@end example

@noindent
and @code{bzip2} and @code{pcre} are problematic when building
@file{libR.so}, only.  These can be avoided by
@option{--without-system-bzlib} and @option{--without-system-pcre}
respectively, but these are the defaults.

Some versions of @command{gcc} may contain what appears to be a bug at
the @option{-O2} optimization level that causes

@example
> 2 %/% 2
[1] 1
> 1:2 %/% 2
[1] 0 0     # wrong!!
@end example

@noindent
which will cause @command{make check} to fail.  If this is the case, you
should use @code{CFLAGS} to specify @option{-O} as the optimization
level to use.

Some systems running HP-UX 11.0 may have a @command{gcc} that was
installed under HP-UX 10.2.  Between versions 10.2 and 11.0 HP-UX
changed its support functions for @acronym{IEEE} arithmetic from the
recommended functions of the @acronym{IEEE} standard to the ones
specified in the C9x draft standard.  In particular, this means that
@code{finite} has been replaced by @code{isfinite}.  A @command{gcc}
configured for HP-UX 10.2 run on 11.0 will not find @code{isfinite}, and
as a result @command{configure} does not recognize the machine as fully
supporting @acronym{IEEE} arithmetic and so will not complete.  The best
solution is to install a properly configured @command{gcc}.  An
alternative work-around is to add @option{-DIEEE_754} to the
@code{CFLAGS} variable.

You can configure @R{} to use both the native @command{cc} and
@command{fort77} with

@example
./configure CC=cc F77=fort77
@end example

@command{f90} insists on linking against a static @file{libF90.a} which
typically resides in a non-standard directory (e.g.,
@file{/opt/fortran90/lib}).  Hence, to use @command{f90} one needs to
add this directory to the linker path via the configure variable
@code{LDFLAGS} (e.g., 
@command{./configure F77=f90 LDFLAGS=/opt/fortran90/lib}).


@node IRIX, Alpha/OSF1, HP-UX, Platform notes
@section IRIX
@cindex IRIX

@R{} 2.1.0 has been successfully built on IRIX64 6.5 using both
@command{gcc} and the native (MipsPro 7.4) compiler. However, neither
version has passed @command{make check} due to a problem with time
zones (see below).  A 64-bit executable has not been successfully
built.

It appears that some (but not all) versions of IRIX have broken
wide-character header files and so may need @option{--disable-mbcs}.

To build @R{} with @command{gcc} use something like the following
configuration flags

@example
CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/freeware/include" 
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/freeware/lib32"
@end example

To build the Tcl/Tk package you will most likely need to add

@example
--with-tclconfig=/usr/freeware/lib/tclConfig.sh
--with-tkconfig=/usr/freeware/lib/tkConfig.sh
@end example

@noindent
since these configuration scripts are not on your path.

To build @R{} with the native compilers, use something like the
following configuration flags

@example
CC=cc F77=f77 CXX=CC 
CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/freeware/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/freeware/lib32" 
CFLAGS="-O2" FFLAGS="-O2" CXXFLAGS="-O2" 
--with-system-bzlib=yes
@end example

The MipsPro compiler will not build the @code{bzlib} library, so you must use
the external one provided by SGI as a freeware package.

After configuration, it is necessary to use @command{gmake} instead of
the native @command{make} to build @R{}.

There is a problem with the time zones on IRIX (originally reported by
George N. White III for 1.9.0) which will cause the @code{strptime}
tests to fail unless Arthur Olson's timezone data
@url{ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/,
@code{ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/@/pub/}} has been installed (see also
@url{http://cspry.co.uk/computing/Indy_admin/TIMEZONE.html,
@code{cspry.co.uk/@/computing/@/Indy_admin/@/TIMEZONE.html}}) and
@code{-ltz} is added to the list of libraries (for example, in
environment variable @env{LIBS}).

The flag @code{-OPT:IEEE_NaN_inf=ON} is added for the native compilers.


@node Alpha/OSF1, Alpha/FreeBSD, IRIX, Platform notes
@section Alpha/OSF1

@R{} has been built successfully on an Alpha running OSF1 V4.0 / V5.1
using @command{gcc}/@command{g77} and @command{cc}/@command{f77}.
Mixing @command{cc} and @command{g77} fails to configure.  The
@command{configure} option @option{--without-blas} was used since the
native blas seems not to have been built with the flags needed to
suppress @code{SIGFPE}'s.  Currently @R{} does not set a signal handler
for @code{SIGFPE} on platforms that support @acronym{IEEE} arithmetic,
so these are fatal.

At some point in the past using @command{cc} required @option{-std1} to
be set so @samp{__STDC__} was defined.  As far as we know this is no
longer needed, and @command{configure} no longer sets it, but it does
set @option{-ieee_with_inexact} for the C compiler and @option{-fpe3}
for the FORTRAN compiler (and @option{-mieee-with-inexact} and
@option{-mieee} for @command{gcc}/@command{g77}) (in the appropriate
@code{R_XTRA_*} flags.

Attempts to build @R{} on an Alpha with FreeBSD 4.3 have been only
partly successful.  Configuring with @option{-mieee} added to both
@code{CFLAGS} and @code{FFLAGS} builds successfully, but tests fail with
@code{SIGFPE}'s.  It would appear that @option{-mieee} only defers these
rather than suppressing them entirely.  Advice on how to complete this
port would be greatly appreciated.


@node AIX, New platforms, Alpha/FreeBSD, Platform notes
@section AIX
@cindex AIX

On AIX 4.3.3 and AIX 5.1/2, it was found that the use of ``run time
linking'' (as opposed to normal AIX style linking) was required.  For
this, the @R{} main program must be linked to the runtime linker with
the @option{-brtl} linker option, and shareable objects must be enabled
for runtime linking with the @option{-G} linker option.  Without these
options, the AIX linker would not automatically link to any shared
object with a @file{.so} extension.  Also, the @R{} main program would
be unable to dynamically load modules (such as X11) with the
@code{dlopen} call.

When setting @code{MAIN_LDFLAGS} and @code{SHLIB_LDFLAGS} accordingly,
note that linker flags must be escaped using @samp{-Wl,} if
@command{gcc} is used for linking: use @samp{MAIN_LDFLAGS="-Wl,brtl"}
and @samp{SHLIB_LDFLAGS="-Wl,-G"} in this case.

Tim Hoar <thoar at cgd dot ucar dot edu> reported success building
@R{} 1.9.0 under AIX 5.1 in 64-bit mode with

@example
OBJECT_MODE=64
CC=/usr/bin/xlc_r
F77=/usr/bin/xlf_r
CXX=/usr/bin/xlC_r
LDFLAGS='-brtl'
CFLAGS='-O -qstrict'
FFLAGS='-O -qstrict'
CXXFLAGS='-O -qstrict'
@end example

@noindent
and the @code{X11()} device worked.  [His system required the
@file{Makeconf} file to be edited to replace @file{/lib/crt0.o} by
@file{/lib/crt0_64.o} in @code{R_XTRA_LIBS}, but @command{configure} now
tries to detect this.]

Paul Boutros reported success building @R{}@tie{}2.0.1 under
AIX@tie{}5.2 with @command{gcc}@tie{}3.3.2 using

@example
OBJECT_MODE=64
MAIN_LDFLAGS=-Wl,-brtl
SHLIB_LDFLAGS=-Wl,-G
@end example

@noindent
(note it is @code{Wl} (W ell) not @code{W1} (W one)).

We understand that @option{--enable-R-shlib} does not work under AIX.

Ei-ji Nakama has reported that @file{src/main/regex.c} in
@R{}@tie{}2.2.0 has to be compiled with @option{-D_LINUX_SOURCE_COMPAT}
in @code{CFLAGS} in AIX@tie{}5.x (and does not work correctly with
AIX@tie{}4.x).  We believe that the patch applied since obviates the
need for this.  He tested @R{}@tie{}2.2.1@tie{}beta on AIX@tie{}5.2.


@node New platforms,  , AIX, Platform notes
@section New platforms

There are a number of sources of problems when installing @R {} on a new
hardware/OS platform.  These include

@strong{Floating Point Arithmetic}: @R{} requires arithmetic compliant
with @acronym{IEC}@tie{}60559, also know as @acronym{IEEE}@tie{}754.
This mandates the use of plus and minus infinity and @code{NaN} (not a
number) as well as specific details of rounding.  Althugh almost all
current FPUs can support this, selecting such support can be a pain.
The problem is that there is no agreement on how to set the signalling
behaviour; Sun/Sparc, SGI/IRIX and @cputype{ix86} Linux require no
special action, FreeBSD requires a call to (the macro)
@code{fpsetmask(0)} and OSF1 requires that computation be done with a
@option{-ieee_with_inexact} flag etc.  On a new platform you must find
out the magic recipe and add some code to make it work.  This can often
be done via the file @file{config.site} which resides in the top level
directory.

Beware of using high levels of optimization, at least initially.  On
many compilers these reduce the degree of compliance to the
@acronym{IEEE} model.  For example, using @option{-fast} on the Solaris
SunPro compilers causes @R{}'s @code{NaN} to be set incorrectly.

@strong{Shared Libraries}: There seems to be very little agreement
across platforms on what needs to be done to build shared libraries.
there are many different combinations of flags for the compilers and
loaders.  @acronym{GNU} libtool cannot be used (yet), as it currently
does not fully support FORTRAN: one would need a shell wrapper for
this).  The technique we use is to first interrogate the X window system
about what it does (using @command{xmkmf}), and then override this in
situations where we know better (for tools from the @acronym{GNU}
Compiler Collection and/or platforms we know about).  This typically
works, but you may have to manually override the results.  Scanning the
manual entries for @command{cc} and @command{ld} usually reveals the
correct incantation.  Once you know the recipe you can modify the file
@file{config.site} (following the instructions therein) so that the
build will use these options.

It seems that @command{gcc}@tie{}3.4.x and later on @cputype{ix86} Linux
defeat attempts by the LAPACK code to avoid computations entirely in
extended-precision registers, so file @file{src/modules/lapack/dlamc.f}
may need to be compiled without optimization.  Set the configure
variable @env{SAFE_FFLAGS} to the flags to be used for this file.  If
configure detects @acronym{GNU} FORTRAN it adds flag
@option{-ffloat-store} to @env{FFLAGS}.  (Other settings are needed when
using @command{icc} on @cputype{ix86} Linux, for example.)

If you do manage to get @R{} running on a new platform please let us
know about it so we can modify the configuration procedures to include
that platform.

If you are having trouble getting @R{} to work on your platform please
feel free to use the @samp{R-devel} mailing list to ask questions.  We
have had a fair amount of practice at porting @R{} to new platforms
@enddots{}



@node Building the GNOME console, Enabling search in HTML help, Platform notes, Top
@appendix Building the @acronym{GNOME} console

This interface is experimental and incomplete.  The console offers a
basic command line editing and history mechanism, along with tool and
button bars that give a point-and-click console to some @R{} commands.
Many of the features of the console are currently stubs, and the console
is no longer under development: it has been kept available as an example
of adding a front-end to @R{}.

A @code{gtk()} graphics device (a port of the @code{x11()} device to
@acronym{GDK} (the GIMP Drawing Kit)) is available from @acronym{CRAN}
as package @pkg{gtkDevice}: this cooperates rather better with the
console than the @code{x11()} device.

The sources for the @acronym{GNOME} console for @R{} are now available
as package @pkg{gnomeGUI} on @acronym{CRAN} and @emph{via} Subversion by
@cindex Subversion

@example
svn co https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/gnomeGUI
@end example

You need to have built @R{} first with the @option{--enable-R-shlib}
option, and installed @R{} to where you are going to use it from.

Please check you have all the requirements.  You need at least the
following packages or later installed:

@example
audiofile-0.2.1
esound-0.2.23
glib-1.2.10
gtk+-1.2.10
imlib-1.9.10
ORBit-0.5.12
gnome-libs-1.4.1.2
libxml-1.8.16
libglade-0.17
@end example

@noindent
It is preferable to have a complete installation of the @acronym{GNOME}
desktop environment.  If you use Linux, then this should be provided
with your distribution.  (Note: @samp{libglade2} is not a suitable
version of @samp{libglade}.)

Remember that some package management systems (such as @acronym{RPM} and
deb) make a distinction between the user version of a package and the
developer version.  The latter usually has the same name but with the
extension @samp{-devel} or @samp{-dev}.  If you use a pre-packaged
version of @acronym{GNOME} then you must have the developer versions of
the above packages in order to compile the R-GNOME console.

It is possible to install the front-end in the same way as an @R{}
package, via @code{R CMD INSTALL} or @code{install.packages}.

For greater control, it can be configured and built independently of
@R{}.  Create a build directory, and from there run

@example
/path/to/gnomeGUI/configure R_HOME=/path/to/R/installation
make
make install
@end example

@noindent
This installs the two files @file{bin/exec/Rgnome} and
@file{share/glade/gnome-interface.glade} in @file{@var{R_HOME}}.

The full list of options to this @command{configure} is

@table @option
@item R_HOME
the directory (containing @file{bin/R}) of the @R{} installation
@item --with-gnome
specify the prefix for the @acronym{GNOME} dirs
@item --with-gnome-includes=@var{DIR}
specify location of @acronym{GNOME} headers
@item --with-gnome-libs=@var{DIR}
specify location of @acronym{GNOME} libs
@item --with-libglade-config=@var{LIBGLADE_CONFIG}
specify location of @command{libglade-config}
@end table

How to invoke the GNOME console is described under @ref{Invoking R, , ,
R-intro, R Introduction and Administration}: in brief, use command-line
option @option{--gui=gnome}.

@code{www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.jsp}} (although that will
fail for earlier versions of Java such as the Microsoft JVM which do
work with R).  Java 1.1 is sufficent.

On Mozilla-based browsers the links on the results page will

Some of these tools are also necessary for building add-on packages from

Your path should include `.' first, then the @file{bin} directories of
the tools, perl, minGW, and @LaTeX{}, as well as the Help Workshop directory.
Do not use filepaths containing spaces: you can always use the
short forms (found by @code{dir /x} at the Windows command line).  
It is essential that the directory containing the
command line tools comes first or second in the path:  there are
typically like-named tools in other directories, and they will
@strong{not} work.  The ordering of the other directories is less
important, but if in doubt, use the order above.

Edit @file{@var{R_HOME}/src/gnuwin32/MkRules} to set the appropriate paths as
needed and to set the type(s) of help that you want built.
@strong{Beware}: @file{MkRules} contains tabs and some editors
(e.g. WinEdt) silently remove them.

Set the appropriate environment variables.
 
Our toolset contains copies of Cygwin dlls that may conflict
with other ones on your system if both are in the path
at once.  The normal recommendation is to delete the older ones;
however, at one time we found our tools did not work with a newer
version of the Cygwin dlls, so it is safest not to have
any other version of the Cygwin dlls in your path.

@section The command line tools

You will need suitable versions of at least @code{basename}, @code{cat},
@code{comm}, @code{cp}, @code{cut}, @code{diff}, @code{echo},
@code{egrep}, @code{expr}, @code{find}, @code{gawk}, @code{grep},
@code{gzip}, @code{head}, @code{ls}, @code{make}, @code{makeinfo},
@code{mkdir}, @code{mv}, @code{rm}, @code{sed}, @code{sh}, @code{sort},
@code{texindex} and @code{touch}; we use those from the Cygwin
distribution (@url{http://www.cygwin.com, @code{www.cygwin.com}}) or
compiled from the sources.  You will also need @code{zip} and
@code{unzip} from the Info-ZIP project (@url{http://www.info-zip.org,
@code{www.info-zip.org}}).  We have packaged a set of all of these tools
at @url{http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/tools.zip,
@code{www.murdoch-sutherland.com/@/Rtools/@/tools.zip}}.

@strong{Beware}: `Native' ports of make are @strong{not} suitable
(including that at the mingw site).  There were also problems with
several earlier versions of the cygwin tools and dll.  To avoid
frustration, please use our tool set, and make sure it is at the front
of your path (including before the Windows system directories).  If you
are using a Windows shell, type @code{PATH} at the prompt to find out.

@node Perl, The MinGW compilers, The command line tools, The Windows toolset
@section Perl

You will need the Windows port of @code{perl5}.  A package containing
this is available from
@url{http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/,
@code{www.activestate.com/@/Products/@/ActivePerl}}.

@strong{Beware}: you do need the @emph{Windows} port and not the Cygwin one.

@node The MinGW compilers, The Microsoft HTML Help Workshop, Perl, The Windows toolset
@section The MinGW compilers

You need a recent version of the MinGW port of @command{gcc} from
@url{http://www.mingw.org, @code{www.mingw.org}}.  See the notes on
@url{http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/,
@code{www.murdoch-sutherland.com/@/Rtools}} for updates.

In late 2005 there was an installer @code{MinGW-5.0.0.exe} in the
`Proposed' section.  Using this, select the @samp{Candidate} package and
add the @samp{g++} and @samp{g77} compilers to the @samp{MinGW base
tools}: components will be downloaded from Sourceforge and unpacked.
Note that you do need the @samp{Candidate} compilers (@code{gcc-3.4.5})
to compile some contributed packages correctly, although
@code{gcc-3.4.2} suffices to build @R{} itself.

An alternative is to download the components individually, currently

@example
gcc-core-3.4.5-20051220-1.tar.gz
gcc-g++-3.4.5-20051220-1.tar.gz
gcc-g77-3.4.5-20051220-1.tar.gz
binutils-2.16.91-20050827-1.tar.gz
mingw-runtime-3.9.tar.gz
w32api-3.5.tar.gz
@end example

@noindent
and unpack these into the same directory (using @command{tar zxf
tarball_name}).  Note that @code{mingw-runtime-3.8.tar.gz} or later is
required to build @R{}.

@node The Microsoft HTML Help Workshop, LaTeX, The MinGW compilers, The Windows toolset
@section The Microsoft @HTML{} Help Workshop

To make compiled html (@file{.chm}) files you will need the Microsoft
@HTML{} Help Workshop, currently available for download at@*
@url{http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwmicrosofthtmlhelpdownloads.asp,
@code{msdn.microsoft.com/@/library/@/en-us/@/htmlhelp/@/html/@/hwmicrosofthtmlhelpdownloads.asp}}@*
and @url{http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/xp/appndx/appa06.htm,
@code{www.microsoft.com/@/office/@/ork/@/xp/@/appndx/@/appa06.htm}}.

You may need this on the same drive as the other tools.  (Although we
regularly use it on a different, problems have been reported in the
past.)

To skip building compiled html help, set @code{WINHELP=NO} in @file{MkRules}.
In this case the Help Workshop will not be needed.

@node LaTeX, The Inno Setup installer, The Microsoft HTML Help Workshop, The Windows toolset
@section @LaTeX{}

The @samp{MiKTeX} (@url{http://www.miktex.org, @code{www.miktex.org}})
distribution of @LaTeX{} includes a suitable port of @code{pdftex}, as
does the @samp{ProText} (@url{http://www.tug.org/protext/,
@code{www.tug.org/@/protext}}) enhanced version.  We have also used the
@samp{fptex} distribution (available from any CTAN node such as
@url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/windows/fptex/,
@code{www.ctan.org/@/tex-archive/@/systems/@/windows/@/fptex}} and as part of
TexLive 2005 (@url{http://www.tug.org/texlive/,
@code{www.tug.org/@/texlive}})).  Another actively-maintained version is
available from @url{http://www.fsci.fuk.kindai.ac.jp/kakuto/win32-ptex/,
@code{www.fsci.fuk.kindai.ac.jp/@/kakuto/@/win32-ptex}}.

Please read @ref{Making the manuals} about how to make @file{refman.pdf}
and set the environment variables @env{R_RD4DVI} and @env{R_RD4PDF}
suitably; ensure you have the required fonts installed.

@node The Inno Setup installer,  , LaTeX, The Windows toolset
@section The Inno Setup installer

To make the installer package (@file{@value{RWVERSION}.exe}) we require
Inno Setup 5.1.5 or later from @url{http://jrsoftware.org,
@code{jrsoftware.org}}.

Edit file @file{src/gnuwin32/MkRules} and change @code{ISDIR} to the
location where Inno Setup was installed.
