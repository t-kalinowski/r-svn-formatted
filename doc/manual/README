The version of Rd.sty here uses url.sty. This is normally installed,
and can be obtained from any CTAN node or mirror: see

	http://www.tug.org/ctan.html

It also uses the standard package bm, which is part of the standard
tools bundle and should be part of any reasonably recent LaTeX
installation.

The reference manual is made using the ae virtual fonts package. If
you do not have that available, you can get it from CTAN, or set the
environment variable R_RD4DVI to "", but the latin1 characters in
text.Rd (and a few other places) will be missing.  The ae font package
provides a reasonable approximation.  You will get better rendition by
setting R_RD4DVI to "" using a Rd.cfg containing

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

BUT you cannot use type-1 postscript fonts with that setting.


Support for making PDF versions of the manuals is currently
experimental.  You will need pdf(la)tex and the hyperref package (and ae,
see above).  Hyperref versions 6.56 and 6.67 are known to work.  If
you want to avoid making the hyperlinks, you can set the environment
variable R_RD4PDF to "ae" (or even to "").

You may well have to increase the poolsize of your pdflatex to process
the reference manual with hyperlinks, particularly with later versions
of hyperref. On a web2c-based system (teTeX, fptex, ...) set the
configuration variable pool_size, for example to 500000. For
pdftex-0.14d you will also need to increase max_strings, for example
to 50000.  The UNIX Makefile does this for you via environment variables,
which should cover most UNIX TeX systems.
