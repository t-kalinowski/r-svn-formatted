precise description) available on the net at

@quotation
@uref{http://bugs.r-project.org/}
@end quotation

and via e-mail to @email{r-bugs@@r-project.org}.  The R function
@code{bug.report()} can be used to invoke an editor from a within an R
session and send the report to the right address.  It also fills in some
basic information, such as your R version and operating system, which
has proved helpful in the debugging process.

The source distribution has a file @file{BUGS} at the top level giving a
summary of the entries at the time this distribution was prepared.
