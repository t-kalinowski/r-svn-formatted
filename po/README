The Makefile.in.in here was originally produced by gettextize, but has
since been modified extensively.

If you convert a C file for use with gettext, add it to POTFILES.in and
then run

make update-po

to recreate R.pot and update the automated `translations'.

To add a new translation, add the lang.po file to this directory and add
the language to LINGUAS.  Hopefully `make' will do the rest 
(create lang.gmo and install it as required).


Windows RGui translations
=========================

These are contained in RGui.pot, created by running 'make RGui.pot-update'
(called by make update-po).

Translations should be called RGui-ll.po for language 'll'.

To add a translation, add its .gmo file to the RGUI-CATALOGS macro
Makefile.win, and both the .po and .gmo files to the RGUI-CATALOGS
macro in Makefile.in.in: it will then be automatically distributed and
installed.
