The Makefile.in.in here was originally produced by gettextize, and seems not
fully correct for our usage.

If you convert a C file for use with gettext, add it to POTFILES.in, and
then run

make update-po

to recreate R.pot.  You then need to update the en.po file here by

msgmerge en.po R.pot > en.po.new

and after checking, copy en.po.new over en.po.  Then delete stamp-po and run
`make', and a new en.gmo should be created.

To add a new translation, add the lang.po file to this directory and add
the language to LINGUAS.  Hopefully `make' will do the rest 
(create lang.gmo and install it as required).
