NB: These instructions are only for R >= 2.16.0, and under development.

If you convert a C file for use with gettext, add it to POTFILES in
this directory and then run (in the 'po' directory in builddir)

	make update-po

to recreate R.pot and update the automated `translations'.

Target

	make update-pkg-po

updates the message catalogs for the C and R code in the standard packages.

If you add a package with translations (hence not datasets), add it to
R_PKGS_PO in po/Makefile.in.  R-level template catalogs (R-pkg.pot)
are produced automatically by 'make update-pkg-po' but for a C-level
template catalog you need to touch src/library/pkg/po/pkg.pot: only do
so once some messages have been marked for translation.

For package translations, add the [R-]lang.po files to the package's
po directory (and perhaps update THANKS).  Note that translations for
the interpreter itself are in src/library/base/po/R.pot.

Note also tools::checkPoFiles().

R-core members: after updating translations, run

       make update-po update-pkg-po update-RGui

and then commit the changes in the svn checkout.


Windows RGui translations
=========================

These are contained in src/library/base/po/RGui.pot, and translations
should be called RGui-ll.po for language 'll'.

To re-make RGui.pot and all the translations use 'make update-RGui'
('make -f Makefile.win update-RGui' on Windows).


Adding translations to other packages
=====================================

See 'Writing R Extensions'.


Subversion note
===============

If you need to add a en@auot file, the current incantation appears to be

svn add .../en@quot.po@

with a trailing @.
