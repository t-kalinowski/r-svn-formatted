The Makefile.in.in here was originally produced by gettextize, but has
since been modified extensively.

If you convert a C file for use with gettext, add it to POTFILES.in and
then run

make update-po

to recreate R.pot.  You then need to update the en.po file here by

msgmerge en.po R.pot > en.po.new

and after checking, copy en.po.new over en.po.  Then delete stamp-po and run
`make', and a new en.gmo should be created.

To add a new translation, add the lang.po file to this directory and add
the language to LINGUAS.  Hopefully `make' will do the rest 
(create lang.gmo and install it as required).


Windows RGui translations
=========================

These are contained in RGui.pot, created by running

cd ../src/gnuwin32
xgettext --keyword=G_ --keyword=GN_ -o ../../po/RGui.pot *.c graphapp/gmenus.c

To install a translation, add its .gmo file to the RGUI-CATALOGS macro
Makefile.win, and both the .po and .gmo files to the RGUI-CATALOGS
macro in Makefile.in.in.  To avoid confusion, call the compiled
translation for language 'll' RGui-ll.gmo.
