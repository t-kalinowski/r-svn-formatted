/*
 *     dqrdc2 uses householder transformations to compute the qr
 *     factorization of an n by p matrix x.  a limited column
 *     pivoting strategy based on the 2-norms of the reduced columns
 *     moves columns with near-zero norm to the right-hand edge of
 *     the x matrix.  this strategy means that sequential one
 *     degree-of-freedom effects can be computed in a natural way.
 *
 *     i am very nervous about modifying linpack code in this way.
 *     if you are a computational linear algebra guru and you really
 *     understand how to solve this problem please feel free to
 *     suggest improvements to this code.
 *
 *     on entry
 *
 *        x       double precision(ldx,p), where ldx .ge. n.
 *                x contains the matrix whose decomposition is to be
 *                computed.
 *
 *        ldx     int.
 *                ldx is the leading dimension of the array x.
 *
 *        n       int.
 *                n is the number of rows of the matrix x.
 *
 *        p       int.
 *                p is the number of columns of the matrix x.
 *
 *        tol     double precision
 *                tol is the nonnegative tolerance used to
 *                determine the subset of the columns of x
 *                included in the solution.
 *
 *        jpvt    int(p).
 *                ints which are swapped in the same way as the
 *                the columns of x during pivoting.  on entry these
 *                should be set equal to the column indices of the
 *                columns of the x matrix (typically 1 to p).
 *
 *        work    double precision(p,2).
 *                work is a work array.
 *
 *     on return
 *
 *        x       x contains in its upper triangle the upper
 *                triangular matrix r of the qr factorization.
 *                below its diagonal x contains information from
 *                which the orthogonal part of the decomposition
 *                can be recovered.  note that if pivoting has
 *                been requested, the decomposition is not that
 *                of the original matrix x but that of x
 *                with its columns permuted as described by jpvt.
 *
 *        k       int.
 *                k contains the number of columns of x judged
 *                to be linearly independent.
 *
 *        qraux   double precision(p).
 *                qraux contains further information required to recover
 *                the orthogonal part of the decomposition.
 *
 *        jpvt    jpvt(k) contains the index of the column of the
 *                original matrix that has been interchanged into
 *                the k-th column, if pivoting was requested.
