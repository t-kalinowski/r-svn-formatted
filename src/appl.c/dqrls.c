 *     dqrfit is a subroutine to compute least squares solutions
 *     to the system
 *
 *     (1)               x * b = y
 *
 *     which may be either under-determined or over-determined.
 *     the user must supply a tolerance to limit the columns of
 *     x used in computing the solution.  in effect, a set of
 *     columns with a condition number approximately bounded by
 *     1/tol is used, the other components of b being set to zero.
 *
 *     on entry
 *
 *        x      double precision(n,p).
 *               x contains n-by-p coefficient matrix of
 *               the system (1), x is destroyed by dqrfit.
 *
 *        n      the number of rows of the matrix x.
 *
 *        p      the number of columns of the matrix x.
 *
 *        y      double precision(n,ny)
 *               y contains the right hand side(s) of the system (1).
 *
 *        ny     the number of right hand sides of the system (1).
 *
 *        tol    double precision
 *               tol is the nonnegative tolerance used to
 *               determine the subset of columns of x included
 *               in the solution.  columns are pivoted out of
 *               decomposition if
 *
 *        jpvt   int(p)
 *               the values in jpvt are permuted in the same
 *               way as the columns of x.  this can be useful
 *               in unscrambling coefficients etc.
 *
 *        work   double precision(2*p)
 *               work is an array used by dqrdc2 and dqrsl.
 *
 *     on return
 *
 *        x      contains the output array from dqrdc2.
 *               namely the qr decomposition of x stored in
 *               compact form.
 *
 *        b      double precision(p,ny)
 *               b contains the solution vectors with rows permuted
 *               in the same way as the columns of x.  components
 *               corresponding to columns not used are set to zero.
 *
 *        rsd    double precision(n,ny)
 *               rsd contains the residual vectors y-x*b.
 *
 *        qty    double precision(n,ny)     t
 *               qty contains the vectors  q y.   note that
 *               the initial p elements of this vector are
 *               permuted in the same way as the columns of x.
 *
 *        k      int
 *               k contains the number of columns used in the
 *               solution.
 *
 *        jpvt   has its contents permuted as described above.
 *
 *        qraux  double precision(p)
 *               qraux contains auxiliary information on the
 *               qr decomposition of x.
 *
 *
 *     on return the arrays x, jpvt and qraux contain the
 *     usual output from dqrdc, so that the qr decomposition
 *     of x with pivoting is fully available to the user.
 *     in particular, columns jpvt(1), jpvt(2),...,jpvt(k)
 *     were used in the solution, and the condition number
 *     associated with those columns is estimated by
 *     abs(x(1,1)/x(k,k)).
 *
 *     dqrfit uses the linpack routines dqrdc and dqrsl.
