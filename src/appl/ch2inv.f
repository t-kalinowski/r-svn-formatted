c ch2inv(x, ldx, n, v, info) computes the inverse of a positive-definite
c		symmetric matrix from its choleski factorization.
c This can be used, e.g., to compute the dispersion matrix for the estimated
c parameters in a regression analysis.
c
c On Entry
c
c	x	double precision(ldx,n)	 {ldx >= n}
c		the choleski decomposition or the qr decomposition
c		as computed by dqrdc or dqrdc2.	 Only the
c		UPPER TRIANGULAR part,	x(i,j), 1 <= i <= j <= n, is accessed.
c
c	ldx	integer, ldx >= n
c		the leading dimension of the array x
c
c	n	integer
c		the number of rows and columns of the matrix x
c
c On Return
c
c	v	double precision(n,n)
c		the value of inverse(x'x)
