		Windows-specific changes to R
		=============================

See the file NEWS for changes that affect all versions of R.


rw2001
======

jpeg(), png() and bmp() were not handling background colours properly.

It seems that on some systems (but not the maintainers') Mozilla 1.7.3
requires \ not / in filepaths, so help(topic, htmlhelp=TRUE) now uses
\.  (PR#7269)  Hopefully no system requires / not \ !

Changes to help() meant that help(topic, chmhelp=TRUE) was no longer
working if `topic' was an alias.  (PR#7269)

Recent changes caused (D)COM to sometimes go into infinite loops.

Any change of preference changed font (even if to the same font as before).
This is causing problems in MDI mode with toolbars (PR#7277).

Control keys in TCL/TK windows were not handled properly.
