		Windows-specific changes to R
		=============================

See the file NEWS for changes that affect all versions of R.


rw2001
======

jpeg(), png() and bmp() were not handling background colours properly.

It seems that on some systems (but not the maintainers') Mozilla 1.7.3
requires \ not / in filepaths, so help(topic, htmlhelp=TRUE) now uses
\.  (PR#7269) Hopefully no system requires / not \!

Changes to help() meant that help(topic, chmhelp=TRUE) was no longer
working if `topic' was an alias.  (PR#7269)

	For changes prior to the release of R 2.0.0 on 4 Oct 2004
