There is a choice of interface for Rgui:

o  SDI, single document interface. This is like the previous version,
   with separate windows for the console, graphics and pager(s).

o  MDI, multiple document interface.  There the console, graphics and
   pagers are subwindows of one main `frame' window.

You can set your preference (and details of the MDI) in the Rconsole
file: this can also be overriden on the command line by --mdi or
--sdi.

If you use multiple files in the SDI pager, the (row) positions are
remembered and re-used.

For MDI pagers, the size is chosen by the system, and only multiple pagers
are supported.

When pagers are re-sized the strategy is now to keep the middle line
in the middle.

The option `setwidthonresize' in Rconsole automatically generates a
call to options("width") if you resize the console width.  This is the
default, but be aware that it pastes a command into the console so
should not be used in the middle of R input.

The file HOME/.Renviron is now read. This can contain environment
variables in NAME=value form, one per line. This is useful for setting
R_VSIZE, R_NSIZE, RLIBS and R_PAPERSIZE, amongst others.

You can now paste in more to the console: the limit (which was 2048
chars) is now that of the clipboard.

The command make pkgcheck-pkgname will do the equivalent of `R CMD
check', that is run all the examples in the help pages for that package.

R-0.64 uses platform-independent code for file handling. Files are
displayed under a pager in a separate window rather than in the
console. 

Environment variables can be set as NAME=value on the command line,
including in a short-cut.

Content of the pager and of the Rgui's console can be printed
using File | Print.

The help, latex and example files can be stored in zip files to save
space; this is used for the base package.

The menus are enabled/disabled and check-marked correctly under NT.
We hope to have solved the 'rw0633 font dimension problem'  shown
under some NT versions.

read.fwf works if you have Perl installed.

help(, offline=TRUE) will work if you have latex installed and
customize RHOME/bin/helpPRINT.bat

The sockets code is compiled in, but we have not tested it.

system() has new arguments `invisible' and `minimized'.

The beginnings of a FAQ (RHOME/rw-faq).

Programs can be launched from all shells: the full path to the
executable is not needed.

Configurable fonts in the graphics devices by the file Rdevga.

Workspaces are saved in XDR format, and so can be shared with most
Unix implementations of R.

Printer and metafile graphics devices (?win.print and ?win.metafile).

Consistent handling of start directory for dialogs and the working
directory across versions of Windows.

An improved and enhanced system() function (?system and ?shell). 

Windows-specific help files where necessary.

Better support for ESS.

Better support for the installation of pre-compiled packages
(?link.html.help)


rw0632
======

The NT copy to the clipboard bug has been fixed.

Help files use latin1 encoding (but, to see the difference, 
you must use a latin1 capable font; for this reason, now, as packed, 
the R console uses "Courier New"; if you don't like it, edit etc/Rconsole).
