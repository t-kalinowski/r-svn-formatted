		Windows-specific changes to R
		=============================

See the file NEWS for changes that affect all versions of R.


rw1010
======

Console preferences editor on the Edit menu in Rgui.

The postscript() device can now spool plots to a printer. You will
need a suitable program to send a file to the spooler (or even to
interpret PostScript for the printer): the RedMon suite available from
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/rjl.html shoudl provide suitable tools.


rw1001
======

The installer, rwinst.exe, now checks for ZIP files as well as zip files.

Under rare conditions (lots of very short input lines) the history buffer
could overrun and so cause crashes. This has been possible since rw0623,
but first caused reported problems in rw1000 and has now been fixed.

Certain HP printer drivers (e.g. the 6/6MP-Postscript driver) reset the
FPU and so were causing crashes.  This has been circumvented in this
version.

Building on a non-default drive should be more reliable, as Perl is
used to find the current drive.
