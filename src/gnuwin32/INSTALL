R for Windows
=============

This distribution contains the sources to build a port of R to run on
(32-bit) Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4, 2000, XP and 2003 on Intel/clone
chips. See the file `README.rw2xxx' for fuller details, including how
to install the binary versions.


Building From Source on Windows
===============================

Details on building R are given in the `R Installation and
Administration' manual in the doc/manual directory.  This is in
texinfo format (R-admin.texi) in the source distribution, and in HTML
and PDF formats in a binary distribution.
