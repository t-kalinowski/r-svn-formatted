R @RVER@ for Windows
====================

This distribution contains the sources to build a port of R-@RVER@ to
run on Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4, 2000 and XP on Intel/clone chips. See the
file `readme' for fuller details, including how to install the binary
versions.


Building From Source on Windows
===============================

[Some further details, including how to debug, are given in the rw-FAQ.]

First collect the tools that you need.  There is a `portal' with
current links at http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/.


Collect the tools
-----------------

You will need suitable versions of at least make, sh, cat, cp, cut,
diff, echo, egrep, expr, grep, ls, mkdir, mv, rm, sed, touch; we use
those from the cygwin distribution
(http://www.cygwin.com/mirrors.html) or (gzip, makeinfo, texindex)
compiled from the sources.  We have packaged a set at
http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/tools.zip.

BEWARE: `Native' ports of make are _not_ suitable (including that at
the mingw site).  There were also problems with several earlier
versions of the cygwin tools and dll.  To avoid frustration, please
use our tool set, and make sure it is at the front of your path.

We recommend that you use a recent snapshot of the Mingw port of gcc
from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/.  For example, at the time
of writing, MinGW-1.1.tar.gz based on gcc-2.95.3.  Just unpack this
somewhere and put its bin directory in your path, *after* our tools.
It is desirable to update the header files, for example with
mingw-runtime-1.3.tar.gz and w32api-1.4.tar.gz.  (It is also possible
to use the beta versions of gcc-3.1 and mingw-runtime-2.0 on that
site, and when released these will become the recommended versions.)

No earlier Mingw compiler has been tested and support for using the
Cygwin compiler has been withdrawn.  If you see errors about `-shared'
not being understood or `__imp_foo' missing, you are not using the
recommended compiler.


The Windows port of perl5, available via
http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/.
BEWARE: you do need the *Windows* port and not the Cygwin one.

zip and unzip from the Info-ZIP project (http://www.info-zip.org and
mirrors, and included in our tools.zip).

PCRE from ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/.
Unpack this (we used prce-3.9.tar.bz2) and copy the files into
src/extra/pcre.


If you want to make compiled html (.chm) files you will need the
Microsoft HTML Help Workshop, currently available for download at

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp
and http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/xp/appndx/appa06.htm

You may need this on the same drive as the other tools. (Although we
have successfully used it elsewhere, others have reported problems).

If you want to make Window help files you will need hcrtf.exe from a
Windows compiler installation (this has been available for download at
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/hcwsetup.exe).

All of these need to be installed and in your path, and the
appropriate environment variables set.  You also need `.' in your path.


Check your path
---------------

You need the following in your path
.
our toolset
mingw\bin
Perl\bin
the latex bin directory
zip.exe, unzip.exe, hhc.exe


Building
--------

You also need the R source (R-@RVER@.tgz).

Then: untar R-@RVER@.tgz somewhere (with no spaces in the path names),

	cd /somewhere/R-@RVER@/src/gnuwin32

IMPORTANT: edit MkRules to set the appropriate paths as needed and to
set the type(s) of help that you want built.

Then run

	make


Note 1: The file @RWVER@\bin\Rchtml.dll is only built if CHM help is
specified in MkRules. Its source is the help directory, and you need
the HTML Help Workshop files to build it. It contains instructions to
build it under VC++6, and it is preferable to use that as the VC++
library will check versions of the components needed. You can just
copy this from a binary distribution.

Note 2: we have had reports that earlier versions of Norton Anti-Virus
locks up the machine when windres is run, so you may need to disable
it. (Norton Anti-Virus 2002 causes no problems.)

Note 3: By default Doug Lea's malloc in the file src/gnuwin32/malloc.c is
used.  You can opt out of this by commenting the line LEA_MALLOC=YES
in MkRules, in which case the Windows malloc is used.  The one
in crtdll.dll is unlikely to be satisfactory: the one in msvcrt.dll
does work but imposes a considerable performance penalty.

Note 4: Function bzfile() is not supported out-of-the-box on this
port: it is straightforward to build libbz2 under mingw32 and define
HAVE_BZLIB in config.h if this is desired.


You can test a build by `make check': expect some differences in the
tests of the print routines.  You may need to set TMPDIR to a suitable
temporary directory: the default is c:\TEMP.


Using ATLAS
-----------

You can make use of ATLAS (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/) fast
BLAS libraries by defining USE_ATLAS=YES in MkRules and specifying the
path to the libraries in macro ATLAS_PATH.

You will need to build the libraries optimized for your architecture
under the Cygwin compilers.  (The pre-compiled libraries on that site
are for Compaq Visual Fortran, and you need to compile for g77.)

For convenience

	make Rblas-clean Rblas

will re-make the Rblas.dll and so allows experimentation with different BLAS
configurations.


Building bitmap device support
------------------------------

The file @RWVER@\bin\Rbitmap.dll is not built automatically:
instructions on how to build it are in the file bitmap\INSTALL.


Building Tcl/Tk support
-----------------------

The TclTk support package is not built automatically.  To use this you
need to download and install ActiveTcl 8.3 from
http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActiveTcl/ and set TCL_HOME
in MkRules to where you installed it (perhaps c:/Program Files/Tcl).
Then

	make tcl

will make the package.



Building the Manuals
====================

To make the PDF versions of the manuals you will need pdftex installed
and configured to work with a large file: see doc/manual/README.  You
also need texindex (included in our tool set).  Then the pdf manuals
can be made by

	make docs

If you want to make the info versions (not the Reference Manual), you
will need a version of makeinfo 4.2 (included in our tool set). Then

	cd ../../doc/manual
	make -f Makefile.win info

will make the info files.

To make DVI versions of the manuals use

	cd ../../doc/manual
	make -f Makefile.win dvi

(assuming you have tex and latex installed and in your path).

To make HTML versions of the manuals (not the Reference Manual) use

	cd ../../doc/manual
	make -f Makefile.win html

This makes use of tidy.exe, available via http://tidy.sourceforge.net/,
with a compiled version included in our tool set.

The fptex distribution of TeX (via www.fptex.org) includes a suitable
port of pdftex.


Building the installers
=======================

See installer/INSTALL.  You need a complete R build first, including 
bitmap and Tcl/Tk support and the manuals, as well as the recommended
packages in R-@RVER@-recommended.tgz.


Recommended packages
====================

The recommended packages can in the main be built as any other package.
boot, cluster, grid, lattice, nlme, rpart and survival should be made with
Rcmd INSTALL --use-zip

KernSmooth, foreign, mgcv and VR can be made by Rcmd INSTALL.  
Package spatial (in VR) will not work if its data directory is zipped.

You cannot currently use Rcmd CHECK to install and check a package
with --use-zip.


Cross-building on ix86 Linux
============================

You will need i386-mingw32 cross-compilers installed and in your path.
There is currently a complete set of tools at

    http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/mingw-cross.tar.bz2

(Just unpack this somewhere and put its bin directory in your path.)

You will need Perl, zip and unzip installed.

You also need the R source (R-@RVER@.tgz).

Then: untar R-@RVER@.tgz somewhere, and

	cd /somewhere/R-@RVER@/src/gnuwin32

Edit MkRules to set BUILD=CROSS and the appropriate paths (including
HEADER) as needed.

Edit MkRules to set the type(s) of help that you want built. (You
will not be able to cross-build .chm or .hlp files,
so WINHELP is automatically set NO.)

Packages can be made in the same way as natively: see the file
readme.packages.

Note that to cross-build the methods package you need a working copy
of this version of R on the Linux system.

(It is possible to cross-build the main installers using WINE, which
we leave as an exercise for the reader.)
