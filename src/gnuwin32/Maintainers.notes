Notes for Windows Maintainers
=============================

1) fixed/h/config.h can be made automatically.  Some of this is
achieved by overrides in the configure script.

You will need a copy of sh.exe in /bin.  Then with the R sources in
/R/rw2000, I used in /TEMP/R (any other directory will do, except the
sources)

sh /R/rw2000/configure --build=i386-pc-mingw32 --with-readline=no --with-x=no --enable-utf8

This ran fairly slowly, producing a src/include/config.h that differs
only in that

 - it found R_PRINTCMD = lpr on my system, but that is not used under 
   Windows, so the actual setting is irrelevant.

 - It found libreadline, not used under Windows.  

Also, watch out for versions of the header files.  For example,
<strings.h> was in mingw-runtime-1.2 and later, but not in the
Mingw-1.1 bundle.

2) The Makefiles for building a distribution have been reorganized.  Now
all of the decisions about what files go into the distributables are made
in installer/Makefile; the decisions about which component of the setup
program each file goes into are made in installer/JRins.pl.

3) Making Tcl/Tk.

Get the Tcl/Tk sources (I used 8.4.5 when testing this).
You need VC++6 and a Windows command-line window.

Run "\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\VCVARS32.BAT"

cd tcl8.4.x\win
nmake -nologo -f makefile.vc release winhelp
nmake -f makefile.vc install
cd ..\..\tk8.4.x\win
nmake -nologo -f makefile.vc TCLDIR=..\..\tcl8.4.x release winhelp
nmake -f makefile.vc install

Now copy /Program Files/Tcl to say /R/Tcl and (in any reasonable shell)
cd /R/Tcl
rm bin/tclpip84.dll bin/tclsh84.exe bin/wish.exe
rm -rf lib/*.lib lib/tk8.4/demos lib/tk8.4/images
cp .../tcl8.4.x/license.terms .
