# This file is used by Rcmd to set the R_TEXOPTS environment variable, 
# which is passed on the command line for latex, pdflatex, etc.
# It must be manually edited if you need to change your TeX options.
# The default setting works with MikTeX; other TeX implementations
# probably need it to be left blank.
