<h1>R-@FULLVERSION@ build for Windows</h1>

<p>This directory contains a Windows binary build of the @DATE@ 
snapshot of R (which will soon become R-@RVER@).</p>

<p>This is a test version of R. <strong>It may contain
bugs, so please watch results carefully as you use it</strong>.  
The more bugs that are caught now, the fewer will make it to the next release.</p>

<p>Please don't report bugs
in this version through the usual R bug reporting system, please report
them on the r-devel mailing list.</p>

<p>The previous
official release is available <a href="index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Patches to the previous release are incorporated in the build
available <a href="rpatched.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The development version (which will eventually become the subsequent
major release) is available <a href="rdevel.html">here</a>.</p>
