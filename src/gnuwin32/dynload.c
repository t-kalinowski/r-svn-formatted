/*  Dynamic Loading Support
 *
 *  This module provides support for run-time loading of shared libraries
 *  access to symbols within such libraries via .C and .Fortran.  This is
 *  done under Unix with dlopen, dlclose and dlsym (the exception is
 *  hpux, where we use compatibility code provided by Luke Tierney.
 *  There are two cases:
 *
 *
 *  1. The dlopen interface is available.
 *
 *  In this case all symbol location is done using the dlopen routines.
 *  We maintain a list of currently loaded shared libraries in an array
 *  called "LoadedDLL" with the number of currenly loaded libraries
 *  being "CountDLL".  To locate a symbol, we probe the loaded libraries
 *  in order until the symbol is located.  If we do not find a symbol
 *  in the loaded libraries, we search the executable itself.  This
 *  search is not very efficient, but this probably pales into
 *  insignificance when compared with the inefficiencies in the R
 *  interpreter.
 *
 *  Loading and unloading of shared libraries is done via the routines
 *  AddDLL and DeleteDLL.  These routines maintain the list of currently
 *  loaded libraries.  When a library is added, any existing reference
 *  to that library are deleted and then the library is inserted at the
 *  start of the search list.  This way, symbols in more recently loaded
 *  libraries are found first.
 *
 *
 *  2. The dlopen interface is not available.
 *
 *  In this case we use the table "CFunTabEntry" to locate functions
 *  in the executable.  We do this by straight linear search through
 *  the table.  Note that the content of the table is created at
 *  system build time from the list in ../appl/ROUTINES.
