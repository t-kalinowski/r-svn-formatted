\title{R for Windows Configuration}
\description{
    The file \code{Rconsole} configures the R GUI console in this
    Windows port. The file \code{Rdevga} configures the graphics devices
    \code{x11}, \code{win.graph}, \code{win.metafile} and \code{win.print}.
}
\value{
    Each of the files contains details in comments of how to set the
    values.

    At the time of writing \code{Rdevga} configured the mapping of font
    numbers to fonts, and \code{Rconsole} configured the font, size and
    colours of the GUI console.
}
\details{
    There are system copies of these files in \code{RHOME\\etc}. Users
    can have personal copies of the files: these are looked for in the
    location given by the environment variable \code{R_HOME}. The system
    files are read only if a corresponding personal file is not found.

    If the environment variable \code{R_HOME} is not set, the \R system
    sets it to \code{HOME} if that is set (stripping any trailing slash)
    otherwise to the working directory.
