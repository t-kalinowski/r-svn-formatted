Frequently Asked Questions for R for Windows</h1>


<p>This FAQ is for the Windows port of R: it describes features
specific to that version. The main R FAQ can be found at <a
href="http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~hornik/R/R-FAQ.html">http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~hornik/R/R-FAQ.html</a>.

<p>There have been two versions of R for Windows, but only is under active
development, that described here. It is often called something like
<tt>rw0990</tt> (although not officially).  The information here
applies only to recent versions (<tt>rw0901</tt> or later).

<p>There is also information on the use of R for Windows in the
Venables & Ripley `R Complements' at <a
href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS2/Compl.shtml">http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS2</a>.

<h2>
1)<a NAME="s1"></a> Installation and Usage</h2>

<h3>
1.1)&nbsp;<a NAME="q11"></a>Where can I find the latest version?</h3>

Go to any CRAN site (see <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html</a>
for a list), navigate to the <tt>bin/windows/windows-NT/base</tt>
directory and collect the files you need. You will need at least the
files
<pre>
      rwXxxxb1.zip rwXxxxb2.zip
      rwXxxxh.zip (text help) or rwXxxxch.zip (Compiled HTML help)
</pre>
and you may want <tt>rwXxxxw.zip</tt> (the HTML format help files) or
<tt>rwXxxxwh.zip</tt> (the Windows help files), <tt>rwXxxxl.zip</tt>
(the LaTeX format help files, used for offline printing), or
<tt>rwXxxxd.zip</tt> (the draft manuals, in PDF).

<p>
Optionally, you can download the installer, <tt>rwinst.exe</tt>.

<h3>
1.2)&nbsp;<a NAME="q12"></a>How do I install R for Windows?</h3>

First, you need Windows 95 or 98 or NT4 or 2000: Windows 3.11+win32s
will not work. Your file system must allow long file names (as is
likely except perhaps for some network-mounted systems).

<p>The simplest way is to run the installer (double-click on the icon
for rwinst.exe and navigate its wizard-like pages).  Alternatively,
choose a location and unzip the zip files (with a tool that preserves
long file names and the directory structure: we recommend the INFO-ZIP
project's <tt>unzip</tt>). All the files will unpack into a directory
called <tt>rwXxxx</tt>, for some `xxx'.

<p>Choose a working directory for R. Make a shortcut to
<tt>rwXxxx\bin\Rgui.exe</tt> on your desktop or somewhere on the <tt>Start
menu</tt> file tree. Right-click the shortcut, select
<tt>Properties...</tt> and change the <tt>`Start in'</tt> field to
your working directory.

<p>You may also want to add command-line arguments at the end of the
<tt>Target</tt> field. We use <tt>--vsize=10M --nsize=400k</tt>.  You
can also set environment variables at the end of the <tt>Target</tt>
field, for example <tt>R_LIBS=e:/R/library</tt>.


<h3>
1.3)&nbsp;<a NAME="q13"></a>How do I run it?</h3>

Just double-click on the shortcut you prepared at installation.

<p>If you want to set up another project, make a new shortcut or use the
existing one, and change the <tt>`Start in'</tt> field of the Properties.

<h3>
1.4)&nbsp;<a NAME="q15"></a>How can I manage my work keeping workspaces
for different projects in different directories?</h3>

Create a separate shortcut for each project: see Q1.3. All the paths to
files used by R are relative to the starting directory, so setting the
<tt>`Start in'</tt> field automatically helps separate projects.

<h3>
1.5)&nbsp;<a NAME="q16"></a>How do I print from R?</h3>
It depends what you want to print.
<ul>
<li>
You can print the graphics window from its menu or by using 
<code>dev.print()</code>.</li>

<li>
You can print from the R console or pager by <tt>File | Print</tt>.

<li>
You can print help files from the page or HTML browser.</li>

<li>
If you have configured <tt>RHOME\bin\helpPRINT.bat</tt> and have
<tt>latex</tt> installed you can print help files by <tt>help(fn_name,
offline=T)</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
1.6)&nbsp;<a NAME="q17"></a>Can I use <tt>R BATCH</tt>?</h3>
No, but you can set up a batch file using <tt>rterm.exe</tt>. A sample
batch file might contain (as one line)
<pre>
path_to_R\bin\rterm.exe --vsize=10M --nsize=500k --no-restore --no-save < %1 > %1.out
</pre>

<h3>
1.7)&nbsp;<a NAME="q18"></a>Can I use <tt>rwXxxx</tt> with ESS and emacs?</h3>

<p>
Yes. The latest versions of ESS (e.g. 5.1.11) come with support for
this version of R, and <tt>rw0650</tt> and later have support for
interrupting the R process from ESS (by </tt>C-c C-c</tt>).

<p>For help with ESS, please send email to 
<code><a
href="mailto:ESS-help@stat.ethz.ch">ESS-help@stat.ethz.ch</a></code>,
not the R mailing lists.

<h3>
1.8)&nbsp;<a NAME="q19"></a>What is my <tt>HOME</tt> directory??</h3>

<p>
Several places in the documentation use these terms.
<p>
The working directory is the directory from which <tt>Rgui</tt> or
<tt>Rterm</tt> was launched, unless a shortcut was used when it is
given by the `Start in' field of the shortcut's properties. You can
find this from R code by the call <tt>getwd()</tt>.

<p>
The home directory is set as follows (<tt>rw0650</tt> on).

<p>
If environment variable <tt>R_USER</tt> is set, its value is used.
Otherwise if environment variable <tt>HOME</tt> is set, its value is
used.  Otherwise if environment variables <tt>HOMEDRIVE</tt> and
<tt>HOMEPATH</tt> are set, the value is
<tt>${HOMEDRIVE}${HOMEPATH}</tt>.  If all of these fail, the current
working directory is used.

<p>
You can find this from R code by <tt>getenv("R_USER")</tt>.
</p>


<h2>
2)&nbsp;<a NAME="s2"></a>Packages</h2>

<h3>
2.1)&nbsp;<a NAME="q21"></a>Can I install packages (libraries) in this
version?</h3>

Yes, of course. The easy way is to see if a pre-compiled binary
version of the package is available: look on CRAN at
<tt>bin/windows/windows-NT/contrib</tt>.  If there is, download the
zip file and unpack it in the <tt>rwXxxx\library</tt> directory, using
<tt>unzip</tt> or similar.  Perhaps even easier is to use the R
function <tt>install.packages</tt>: check out its help page.


<p>If there is not a binary version or that is not up-to-date or you
prefer compiling from source, get <tt>rwXxxxsp.zip</tt> from the
distribution (see Q1.1) and unpack it in <tt>rwXxxx</tt>. Then cd
<tt>src\gnuwin32</tt> and read <tt>README.packages</tt>. You will need
to collect and install several tools to use this. Once you have done
so, installation is easy: just run <tt>`make pkg-pkgname'</tt>.  To
check the package (run all the examples on its help pages) use
<tt>`make pkgcheck-pkgname'</tt>.

<h3>
2.2)&nbsp;<a NAME="q22"></a>I don't have permission to write to the
<tt>rwXxxx\library</tt> directory. Is this fatal?</h3>

<p>You can install packages anywhere and use the environment variable
<tt>R_LIBS</tt> to point to the library location(s). You can also set
the R variable <tt>`.lib.loc'</tt> in your <tt>.Rprofile</tt> or when
running R.

<p>Suppose your packages are in installed in
<tt>p:\mylibs</tt>. Then you can EITHER <p>set <tt>RLIBS</tt> to
<tt>p:\mylibs</tt> <p>OR put in the <tt>.Rprofile</tt> in the working
directory or your home directory 
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .lib.loc &lt;- c("p:/mylibs", .Library)
</pre>
OR use a package by, e.g.
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library(MASS, lib.loc="p:/mylibs")
</pre>
How you set an environment variable is system specific: in Windows 9x you can
set them in <tt>autoexec.bat</tt> or in an MS-DOS window from which
you launch <tt>Rgui/Rterm</tt>.  Under Windows NT you can use the control
panel.  You can also set them on the command line, for example in the
shortcut you could have
<pre>
path_to_R\bin\rgui.exe --vsize=10M R_LIBS=e:/R/library
</pre>
and you can set variables in a file <tt>.Renviron</tt> in the working
directory or your home directory, for example
<pre>
      R_LIBS=e:/R/library
      R_VSIZE=10M
      R_NSIZE=400k
</pre>
The order of precedence is the command line then <tt>.Renviron</tt>
then the inherited environment.


<p>You can also build packages anywhere, but that is much trickier: it
is simpler to install a private copy of R to do the building.

<h3>
2.3)&nbsp;<a NAME="q23"></a>The packages I installed do not appear in the
HTML help system.</h3>

HTML help only works for packages installed in <tt>rwXxxx\library</tt>.

<p>To update the HTML help files after you have installed a binary
package, run at the R prompt
<pre>
      > link.html.help()
</pre>
(Using <tt>install.packages()</tt> does this for you.  The source-code
installation also does this automatically, and if you have that
installed you can use (preferably)
<pre>
      cd rwXxxx\src\gnuwin32\help
      make indices
</pre>
instead.)

<h3>
2.4)&nbsp;<a NAME="q24"></a>The functions in the packages I installed are
not found by the HTML help search system.</h3>

The following conditions need to hold:
<ul>
<li>
the package is installed in <tt>rwXxxx\library</tt>.</li>

<li>
the package contains a <tt>CONTENTS</tt> file in top-level directory
(many of the binary distributions do not).</li>

<li>
you updated the indices as described in the answer to Q2.2 after installing
the package.</li>
</ul>
If those all hold true, this works for us.
<h2>
3)&nbsp;<a NAME="s3"></a>Windows Features</h2>

<h3>
3.1)&nbsp;<a NAME="q31"></a>What should I expect to behave differently
from the Unix/GNU-Linux version of R?</h3>

<ul>
<li>
R commands can be interrupted by <tt>Esc</tt> in <tt>rgui.exe</tt> and
<tt>Ctrl-break</tt> or <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> in <tt>rterm.exe</tt>:
<tt>Ctrl-C</tt> is used for copying in the GUI version.</li>

<li>
Command-line editing is always available, but is much simpler than the
readline-based editing on Unix. For <tt>rgui.exe</tt>, the menu item
<tt>`Help | Console'</tt> will give details.</li>

<li>
The commands history is saved between sessions only on
<tt>rgui.exe</tt>, and it is always saved.</li>

<li>
Using <tt>help.start()</tt> does not automatically send help requests
to the browser: use <tt>options(htmlhelp=T)</tt> to turn this on.</li>

<li>
The HTML help system can only access packages installed in the
standard place.</li>

<li>
Paths to files (e.g. in source()) can be specified with either
<tt>"/"</tt> or <tt>"\\"</tt>.</li>

<li>
<tt>system()</tt> is slightly different: see its help page and that of
<tt>shell()</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
3.2)&nbsp;<a NAME="q32"></a>I hear about some nifty features: please tell
me about them!</h3>

You have read the <tt>README</tt>? There are file menus on both the R
console and on graphics windows. You can source and save from those
menus, and copy the graphics to gif, postscript or metafile.There are
right-click menus giving shortcuts to menu items, and optionally
toolbars with buttons giving shortcuts to frequent operations.

The graphics has a history mechanism. As the <tt>README</tt> says:

<p>`The History menu allows the recording of plots. When plots have
been recorded they can be reviewed by PgUp and PgDn, saved and
replaced. Recording can be turned on automatically (the Recording item
on the list) or individual plots can be added (Add or the INS
key). The whole plot history can be saved to or retrieved from an R
variable in the global environment.  

<p>There is only one graphics history shared by all the x11 devices.'

<p>The R console and graphics windows have configuration files stored
in the <tt>RHOME\etc</tt> directory called <tt>Rconsole</tt> and
<tt>Rdevga</tt>; you can keep personal copies in your <tt>HOME</tt>
directory. They contain comments which should suffice for you to edit
them to your preferences. For more details see <tt>?Rconsole</tt>.

<h2>
4)&nbsp;<a NAME="s4"></a>Workspaces</h2>

<h3>
4.1)&nbsp;<a NAME="q41"></a>My workspace gets saved in a strange place:
how do I stop this?</h3>

Have you changed the working directory?: see Q4.2.

<h3>
4.2)&nbsp;<a NAME="q42"></a>How do I store my workspace in a different
place?</h3>

Use the <tt>`File | Change Dir'</tt> menu item to select a new working
directory: this defaults to the last directory you loaded a file from.
The workspace is saved in the working directory.  You can also save a
snapshot of the workspace from the <tt>Save Image</tt> menu item.

<h3>
4.3)&nbsp;<a NAME="q44"></a>Can I load workspaces saved under Unix/GNU-Linux?</h3>

Yes. The converse (saving on Windows, loading on Unix) also works.

<h2>
5)&nbsp;<a NAME="s5"></a>The R Console and Fonts</h2>

<h3>
5.1)&nbsp;<a NAME="q51"></a>I would like to be able to use Japanese fonts
in the console and to annotate graphs.</h3>

We believe this is possible by setting suitable fonts in the
<tt>Rconsole</tt> and <tt>Rdevga</tt> configuration files (see
Q3.2). You can specify additional fonts in <tt>Rdevga</tt>, and use them by
<pre>
     par(font=, font.lab=, font.main=, font.sub=)
</pre> 
Nineteen fonts are specified (as 1 to 19) by default: you can add to 
these (up to 13 more) or replace them.

<h3>
5.2)&nbsp;<a NAME="q52"></a>I don't see characters with accents at the
R console, for example in <tt>?text</tt>.</h3>

You need to specify a font in <tt>Rconsole</tt> (see Q3.2) that
supports <tt>latin1</tt> encoding. The default, <tt>Courier New</tt>,
does on our systems, as does <tt>FixedSys</tt>.  This may be a problem
in other locales, especially for non-Western European languages.

<h3>
5.3)&nbsp;<a NAME="q53"></a>When using <tt>Rgui</tt>, the output to the
console seems to be delayed.</h3>

This is deliberate: the console output is buffered and re-written in
chunks to be less distracting. You can turn buffering off or on from
the Misc menu or the right-click menu: <tt>Ctrl-W</tt> toggles the
setting.

<p>If you are sourcing R code or writing from a function, there is
another option. A call to the R function <tt>flush.console()</tt> will
write out the buffer and so update the console.

<h2>
6)&nbsp;<a NAME="s6"></a>Building from Source</h2>

<h3>
6.1)&nbsp;<a NAME="q61"></a>How can I compile R from source?</h3>
Get the R sources. Suppose you want to compile
<tt>R-0.99.0</tt>.
<pre>
      tar zxvf R-0.99.0.tgz
      cd R-0.99.0
      cd src\gnuwin32
</pre>
Now read the <tt>INSTALL</tt> file and set up all the tools
needed. Then you can just use <tt>`make'</tt>, sit back and wait. (A
complete build takes about 15 minutes on a 300MHz PII with a fast
local disc.)

<p>You may need to compile under a case-honouring file system: we found
that a samba-mounted file system (which maps all file names to lower
case) did not work.

<h3>
6.2)&nbsp;<a NAME="q62"></a>How do I debug code that I have compiled and
<tt>dyn.load</tt>-ed?</h3>

<p>
First, build a version of the R system with debugging information by
<pre>
      make clean
      make DEBUG=T
</pre>

and make a debug version of your package by
<pre>
      make DEBUG=T pkg-mypkg
</pre>

Then you can debug by
<pre>
      gdb /path/to/rwXxxx/bin/Rgui.exe
</pre>

However, note
<ul>
<li> <tt>gdb</tt> will only be able to find the source code if we run
     in the location where the source was compiled 
     (<tt>rwXxxx/src/gnuwin32</tt> for the main system, 
     <tt>rwXxxx/src/library/mypkg/src</tt> for a package), 
     unless told otherwise by the <tt>`directory'</tt> command. It is
     most convenient to set a list of code locations via 
     <tt>`directory'</tt> commands in the file <tt>.gdbinit</tt> in the
     directory from which <tt>gdb</tt> is run.

<li> It is only possible to set breakpoints in a DLL after the DLL has
     been loaded. So a way to examine the function <tt>tukeyline</tt>
     in package <tt>eda</tt> might be
<pre>
           gdb ../../../../bin/Rgui.exe
           (gdb) break WinMain
           (gdb) run
           [ stops with R.dll loaded ]
           (gdb) break R_ReadConsole
           (gdb) continue
           [ stops with console running ]
           (gdb) continue
           Rconsole> library(eda)
           (gdb) break tukeyline
           (gdb) clear R_ReadConsole
           (gdb) continue
</pre>
Fortran symbols need an underline appended.

<li> Windows has little support for signals, so the usual idea of running a
     program under a debugger and sending it a signal to interrupt it and
     drop control back to the debugger does not work with <tt>mingw32</tt>
     version of <tt>gdb</tt>.  It does often work with the 
     <tt>cygwin</tt> version.

<li> We have seen examples in debugging problems with Windows events
     that the <tt>cygwin</tt> <tt>gdb</tt> was able to catch but which
     terminated the <tt>mingw32</tt> <tt>gdb</tt>.
</ul>

If you have an X server available on the PC, there is a version of
<tt>DDD</tt> available that runs under the cygwin emulation layer
(follow the links at <a
href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin">sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin</a>)
and provides a graphical user interface to <tt>gdb</tt>.
Another (Windows-native) GUI for <tt>gdb</tt> is
<a
href="ftp://ftp.xraylith.wisc.edu/pub/khan/gnu-win32/cygwin/ports/">Insight</a>
.

</p>

<h3>
6.3)&nbsp;<a NAME="q63"></a>How do I include C++ code?</h3>

<p>
You need to do two things:
</p>
<p>
(a) Write a wrapper to export the symbols you want to call from R as
<tt>extern "C"</tt>.
</p>
<p>
(b) Include the C++ libraries in the link to make the DLL. Suppose
<tt>X.cc</tt> contains your C++ code, and <tt>X_R.cc</tt> is the
wrapper. Then build the DLL by (<tt>gcc-2.95.x</tt>)
<pre>
    g++ -c X.cc X_R.cc
    dlltool --export-all-symbols --output-def X.def X_R.o
    dllwrap -o X.dll --def X.def X.o X_R.o -lstdc++
</pre>
<p>
or (VC++)
</p>
<pre>
   cl /MT /c X.cpp X_R.cpp
   link /dll /out:XX.dll /export:X_main X.obj X_R.obj
</pre>
<p>
and call the entry point(s) in <tt>X_R</tt>.  Construction of static variables
will occur when the DLL is loaded, and destruction when the DLL is
unloaded, usually when R terminates.
</p>


<h3>
6.4)&nbsp;<a NAME="q64"></a>The output from my C code disappears. Why?</h3>

<p>
The <tt>Rgui.exe</tt> console is a Windows application: writing to
<tt>stdout</tt> or <tt>stderr</tt> will not produce output in the
console. (This <em>will</em> work with <tt>Rterm.exe</tt>.)  Use
<tt>Rprintf</tt> instead.
