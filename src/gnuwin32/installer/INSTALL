Windows-style Installer
=======================

You can make an install package (SetupR.exe) in the usual Windows style
(by default in Windows 2000 style) by using the installer kit 
Inno Setup 2.0.17 or later from www.jrsoftware.org. 

First go to the parent of this directory and make the distribution zip
files by

make tcl
make distribution

Then in this directory, edit ISDIR in Makefile and then run

make
make ISclean

You will have SetupR.exe and a set of files miniR* for the floppy-sized
distribution.
