Making the standard installer
=============================

You can make an install package (R-x.y.z-win32.exe) in the current
Windows style by using the installer kit Inno Setup 5.1.2 or later
from jrsoftware.org.

You need the R installation built completely (see ../INSTALL: this
includes making bitmap and Tcl/Tk support and the manuals).
It's worthwhile testing it too!

Go to the parent of this directory and edit ISDIR in ../MkRules and run

make distribution
make clean

You will have R-x.y.z-win32.exe both in this dir and in the cran dir.

Note that building the installer needs ca 85Mb of free memory.


Making a custom installer
=========================

1) If you want to customize the installation by adding extra packages,
replace `make distribution' by something like

	make distribution EXTRA_PKGS='pkg1 pkg2 pkg3'


2) If you don't want to make R from the sources yourself, make a full
installation of R from the standard installer (that is, select 'Full
Installation' from the 'Select Components' screen), then add packages
and make other customizations.

Edit ISDIR in ../MkRules if you have not already done so.  Then in
this directory run

	make myR IMAGEDIR=rootdir

where `rootdir' is the path to the root of the customized installation
(forward slashes and no spaces, please).
