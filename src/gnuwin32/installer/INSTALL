Windows-style Installer
=======================

You can make an install package (SetupR.exe) in the usual Windows style
(by default in Windows 2000 style) by using the installer kit 
Inno Setup 2.0.9 (or later) from www.jrsoftware.org. 

First go to the parent of this directory and make the distribution zip
files by

make tcl
make distribution
make packagedist

Then in this directory, edit ISDIR in Makefile and run

make
make ISclean


BDR's rwinst
============

This is obselete and no longer maintained.

You need to get Info-Zip's unzip542.zip from one of many mirrors, and
unzip it in this directory, with say

	unzip unzip542.zip -d unzip

Then alter UNZIPDIR in the Makefile if necessary and run `make'.

dounzip.c is based rather loosely on the windll/uzexampl.c file.
