@chapter Introduction


This FAQ is for the Windows port of R: it describes features specific to
that version. The main R FAQ can be found at

@display
@uref{http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~hornik/R/R-FAQ.html}.
@end display

The information here applies only to recent versions of R for Windows,
(@code{rw1020} or later); the current version is often called something like
@code{@value{VERSION}} (although not officially).

@node Where can I find the latest version?, How do I install R for Windows?, Installation and Usage, Installation and Usage
@section Where can I find the latest version?

Go to any CRAN site (see @uref{http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html}
for a list), navigate to the @code{bin/windows/base}
directory and collect the files you need. You will need at least the
files

@example
      @RWVER@b1.zip @RWVER@b2.zip
      @RWVER@h.zip (text help) or @RWVER@ch.zip (Compiled HTML help)
@end example
@noindent
and you may want @code{@RWVER@wh.zip} (the Windows help files) or
@code{@RWVER@w.zip} (the HTML format help files), @code{@RWVER@l.zip} (the
LaTeX format help files, used for offline printing), or
@code{@RWVER@d?.zip} (the draft manuals, in PDF).

Optionally, you can download the installer, @code{rwinst.exe}.

Alternatively, two installers based on Inno Setup are available.  One,
@code{SetupR.exe}, is about 10Mb and gives a complete installation. The
other, @code{miniR.exe}, is a small installation and comes in five files
which fit onto four floppy discs.


@node How do I install R for Windows?, How do I run it?, Where can I find the latest version?, Installation and Usage
@section How do I install R for Windows?

First, you need Windows 95/98/ME/NT4/2000: Windows 3.11+win32s will not
work.  Your file system must allow long file names (as is likely except
perhaps for some network-mounted systems).

The simplest way is to use @code{SetupR.exe} or @code{miniR.exe}. Just
double-click on the icon and follow the instructions.  If you installed
R this way you can uninstall it from the Control Panel or Start Menu
(unless you supressed making a group for R).

The next-simplest way is to run the installer (double-click on the icon for
@code{rwinst.exe} and navigate its wizard-like pages).  Alternatively,
choose a location and unzip the zip files (with a tool that preserves
long file names and the directory structure: we recommend the INFO-ZIP
project's @code{unzip}). All the files will unpack into a directory
@code{@RWVER@}.

Choose a working directory for R. Unless you used @code{SetupR.exe} or
@code{miniR.exe} (which did this for you), make a shortcut to
@code{@RWVER@\bin\Rgui.exe} on your desktop or somewhere on the Start
menu file tree. Right-click the shortcut, select Properties... and
change the `Start in' field to your working directory.

You may also want to add command-line arguments at the end of the Target
field, for example @code{--sdi --max-mem-size=40M}. You can also set
environment variables at the end of the Target field, for example
@code{R_LIBS=e:/R/library}.


@node How do I run it?, There seems to be a limit on the memory it uses!, How do I install R for Windows?, Installation and Usage
@section How do I run it?

Just double-click on the shortcut you prepared at installation.

If you want to set up another project, make a new shortcut or use the
existing one, and change the `Start in' field of the Properties.

@node There seems to be a limit on the memory it uses!, How can I keep workspaces for different projects in different directories?, How do I run it?, Installation and Usage
@section There seems to be a limit on the memory it uses!

Indeed there is.  It is set by the command-line flag
@code{--max-mem-size} and defaults to the smaller of the amount of
physical RAM in the machine and 256Mb.  It can be set to any amount over
10M.  Be aware though that Windows has (in most versions) a maximum
amount of user virtual memory of 2Gb, and parts of this can be reserved
by processes but not used.  R itself reserves 256Mb on startup.  Because
of the way the memory manager works, it is possible that there will be
free memory but R will not be able to reserve it.

Use @code{?Memory} and @code{?memory.size} for information about memory
usage.

R can be compiled to use a different memory manager which may be better
at using large amounts of memory, but is substantially slower (making R
several times slower on some tasks).


@node How can I keep workspaces for different projects in different directories?, How do I print from R?, There seems to be a limit on the memory it uses!, Installation and Usage
@section How can I keep workspaces for different projects in different directories?

Create a separate shortcut for each project: see Q2.3. All the paths to
files used by R are relative to the starting directory, so setting the
`Start in' field automatically helps separate projects.


@node How do I print from R?, Can I use R BATCH?, How can I keep workspaces for different projects in different directories?, Installation and Usage
@section How do I print from R?

It depends what you want to print.

@itemize @bullet
@item You can print the graphics window from its menu or by using
@code{dev.print()}.
@item You can print from the R console or pager by @code{File | Print}.
(This will print the selection if there is one,
otherwise the whole console or pager contents.)
@item You can print help files from the pager or HTML browser.
@item If you have configured @code{RHOME\bin\helpPRINT.bat} and have
latex installed you can print help files by @code{help(fn_name, offline=TRUE)}.
@end itemize

@node Can I use R BATCH?, Can I use @RWVER@ with ESS and emacs?, How do I print from R?, Installation and Usage
@section Can I use @code{R BATCH}?

Yes, if you have Perl and the files for making source packages (from
@code{@RWVER@sp.zip}) installed.  The Windows analogue is @code{Rcmd
BATCH}: use @code{Rcmd BATCH --help} for full details.

Otherwise you can set up a batch file using @code{Rterm.exe}. A sample
batch file might contain (as one line)

@example
path_to_R\bin\Rterm.exe --no-restore --no-save < %1 > %1.out
@end example

@node Can I use @RWVER@ with ESS and emacs?, What are HOME and working directories?, Can I use R BATCH?, Installation and Usage
@section Can I use @RWVER@ with ESS and emacs?

Yes. The latest versions of ESS (e.g. 5.1.18) come with support for this
version of R, and there is support for interrupting the R process from
ESS (by @code{C-c C-c}).

For help with ESS, please send email to @email{ESS-help@@stat.ethz.ch},
not the R mailing lists.


@node What are HOME and working directories?, R can't find my file, Can I use @RWVER@ with ESS and emacs?, Installation and Usage
@section What are HOME and working directories?

Several places in the documentation use these terms.

The working directory is the directory from which @code{Rgui} or
@code{Rterm} was launched, unless a shortcut was used when it is given
by the `Start in' field of the shortcut's properties. You can find this
from R code by the call @code{getwd()}.

The home directory is set as follows:@*
If environment variable @code{R_USER} is set, its value is used.@*
Otherwise if environment variable @code{HOME} is set, its value is used.@*
Otherwise if environment variables @code{HOMEDRIVE} and @code{HOMEPATH}
are set, the value is @code{$@{HOMEDRIVE@}$@{HOMEPATH@}}.@*
If all of these fail, the current working directory is used.

You can find this from R code by @code{Sys.getenv("R_USER")}.

@node R can't find my file, Does R use the Registry?, What are HOME and working directories?, Installation and Usage
@section R can't find my file, but I know it is there!

How did you specify it?  Backslashes have to be doubled in R character
strings, so for example one needs
@code{"d:\\rw1021\\library\\xgobi\\scripts\\xgobi.bat"}.
Make life easier for yourself by using forward slashes as path
separators: they do work under Windows.

Another possible source of grief is spaces in folder names.  We have
tried to make R work on paths with spaces in, but lots of people writing
packages for Unix do not bother. So it is worth trying the alternative
short name (something like @code{PROGRA~1}; you can get it as the
`MS-DOS name' from the Properties on most versions of Windows).

@node Does R use the Registry?,  , R can't find my file, Installation and Usage
@section Does R use the Registry?

Not itself.  The Inno Setup-based installers set some entries to allow
uninstallation.  In addition those installers and (by default, but it
can be unchecked) @code{rwinst.exe} set a Registry key
@code{LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\R-core\R} giving the version and install
path.  Again, this is not used by R itself, but it will be used by the
DCOM interface (@uref{http://cran.r-project.org/other-software.html}).

You can add the Registry entries by running @code{RSetReg.exe} in the
@code{bin} folder, and remove them by running this with argument
@code{/U}.  Note that the settings are all per machine and not per user.

@node Can I install packages (libraries) in this version?, I don't have permission to write to the @RWVER@\library directory, Packages, Packages
@section Can I install packages (libraries) in this version?

Yes, but you will need a lot of tools to do so, unless the author or the
maintainers of the @code{bin/windows/contrib} section on CRAN has been
kind enough to provide a pre-compiled version for Windows as a
@code{.zip} file.

You can install pre-compiled packages either from CRAN or from a local
@code{.zip} file by using @code{install.packages}: see its help page.
There are menu items on the @code{Packages} menu to provide a
point-and-click interface to package installation.

Note that the pre-compiled versions on CRAN are unsupported: see
@url{http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/ReadMe}

If there is not a pre-compiled version or that is not up-to-date or you
prefer compiling from source, get @code{@RWVER@.zip} from the
distribution (see Q1.1) and unpack it in @code{@RWVER@}.  Then read the
@file{readme.packages}.  You will need to collect and install several
tools to use this.  Once you have done so, just run @code{Rcmd INSTALL
pkgname}. To check the package (run all the examples on its help pages
and in its test suite, if any) use @code{Rcmd check pkgname}: see the
`Writing R Extensions' manual.

@node I don't have permission to write to the @RWVER@\library directory, The packages I installed do not appear in the HTML help system, Can I install packages (libraries) in this version?, Packages
@section I don't have permission to write to the @file{@RWVER@\library} directory.

You can install packages anywhere and use the environment variable
@code{R_LIBS} to point to the library location(s). You can also set the
R variable @code{.lib.loc} in your @file{.Rprofile} or when running R.

Suppose your packages are installed in @code{p:\mylibs}. Then you can EITHER

@example
set the environment variable R_LIBS to p:\mylibs
@end example
@noindent
OR put in the @code{.Rprofile} in the working directory or your home directory

@example
.lib.loc <- c("p:/mylibs", .Library)
@end example
@noindent
OR use a package by, e.g.

@example
library(MASS, lib.loc="p:/mylibs")
@end example

How you set an environment variable is system specific: in Windows 9x
you can set them in autoexec.bat or in an MS-DOS window from which you
launch @code{Rgui} / @code{Rterm}.  Under Windows NT/2000 you can use
the control panel or the properties of `My Computer'.  Under Windows Me
you need to use the System Configuration Utility (under Programs,
Accessories, System Tools on the Start menu).  You can also set them on
the command line, for example in the shortcut you could have

@example
path_to_R\bin\Rgui.exe R_LIBS=e:/R/library
@end example
@noindent
and you can set variables in a file @file{.Renviron} in the working directory
or your home directory, for example

@example
R_LIBS=e:/R/library
@end example

The order of precedence is the command line then @file{.Renviron} then
the inherited environment.


@node The packages I installed do not appear in the HTML help system, My functions are not found by the HTML help search system., I don't have permission to write to the @RWVER@\library directory, Packages
@section The packages I installed do not appear in the HTML help system.

HTML help only works for packages installed in @file{@RWVER@\library}.

To update the HTML help files after you have installed a pre-compiled
package, run at the R prompt.

@example
> link.html.help()
@end example



@node My functions are not found by the HTML help search system., Loading a package fails., The packages I installed do not appear in the HTML help system, Packages
@section My functions are not found by the HTML help search system.

The following conditions need to hold for functions in a package you installed.

@itemize @bullet
@item the package is installed in @file{@RWVER@\library}.
@item the package contains a @file{CONTENTS} file in its top-level directory.
@item you updated the indices as described in the answer to Q3.3 after
installing the package.
@end itemize
@noindent
If those all hold true, this works for us.

@node Loading a package fails., Package TclTk does not work., My functions are not found by the HTML help search system., Packages
@section Loading a package fails.

Is the package compiled for this version of R?  Many of the packages
need to be compiled for a fairly recent version, and in particular a
substantial minority need to be re-compiled for @code{rw1020} and later.

You can tell the version the package was compiled for by looking at the
@code{Built:} line in its @file{DESCRIPTION} file or at the
@code{Version} tab of its DLL (if it has one) in the @file{libs}
directory.  (Right-click on the DLL in Windows Explorer, and select
@code{Properties} or use the @code{DLL.version} function inside R.)
If there is no @code{Built:} line or version tab, the package was
compiled too long ago.


@node Package TclTk does not work., Hyperlinks in Compiled HTML do not work., Loading a package fails., Packages
@section Package TclTk does not work.

For package @code{tcltk} to work (try @code{demo(tkdensity)} or
@code{demo(tkttest)}) you need to have Tcl installed.  Download
@file{tcl832.exe} (or use @file{tcl831.exe} if you already have it) from
@url{dev.scriptics.com} and install it. (That will put the @file{bin}
directory containing the Tcl and Tk DLLs in your path).  You then need
to set the environment variable @code{TCL_LIBRARY}, to something like
@code{c:/Program Files/Tcl/lib/tcl8.3}.  (The startup code for the
package will warn you if this is unset, and Q3.2 explains how to set
them.  NB: do not quote the path, even if as here it contains spaces.)

@node  Hyperlinks in Compiled HTML do not work.,  , Package TclTk does not work., Packages
@section Hyperlinks in Compiled HTML sometimes do not work.

Unfortunately, hyperlinks in compiled HTML files used from R are
interpreted relative to the current working directory of the R process,
not relative to the @code{pkg.chm} file.  This was not discovered until
@code{rw1021}, so only files made since that version are working
correctly.  Remake the package under @code{rw1021} or later to cure
this.

@end itemize

@node I hear about some nifty features. Please tell me about them!, Circles appear as ovals on screen, What should I expect to behave differently from the Unix version of R?, Windows Features
@section I hear about some nifty features: please tell me about them!

You have read the @code{README}? There are file menus on the R console,
pager and graphics windows. You can source and save from those menus,
and copy the graphics to @code{png}, @code{jpeg}, @code{bmp},
@code{postscript} or @code{metafile}. There are right-click menus giving
shortcuts to menu items, and optionally toolbars with buttons giving
shortcuts to frequent operations.

If you resize the R console the @code{options(width=)} is automatically
set to the console width (unless disabled in the configuration file).

The graphics has a history mechanism. As the README says:

@quotation
`The History menu allows the recording of plots. When plots have been
recorded they can be reviewed by @key{PgUp} and @key{PgDn}, saved and
replaced.  Recording can be turned on automatically (the Recording item
on the list) or individual plots can be added (Add or the @key{INS}
key). The whole plot history can be saved to or retrieved from an R
variable in the global environment.

There is only one graphics history shared by all the windows devices.'
@end quotation
@noindent
The R console and graphics windows have configuration files stored in
the @file{RHOME\etc} directory called @file{Rconsole} and @file{Rdevga};
you can keep personal copies in your @file{HOME} directory. They contain
comments which should suffice for you to edit them to your
preferences. For more details see @code{?Rconsole}.
There is a Preferences editor invoked from the @code{Edit} menu which
can be used to edit the file @file{Rconsole}.

@node Circles appear as ovals on screen,  , I hear about some nifty features. Please tell me about them!, Windows Features
@section Circles appear as ovals on screen

The graphics system asks Windows for the number of pixels per inch in
the X and Y directions, and uses that to size graphics (which in R are
in units of inches).  Sometimes the answer is a complete invention, and
in any case Windows will not know exactly how the horizontal and
vertical size have been set on a CRT.  You can specify correct values
either in the call to @code{windows} or as options: see @code{?windows}.
(Typically these are of the order of 80.)

On one of our systems, the screen height is reported as 240mm, and the
width as 300mm in 1280 x 1024 mode and 320mm in 1280 x 960 and 1600 x 1200
modes. In fact it is a 21" monitor and 400mm x 300mm!

You need to specify a font in Rconsole (see Q4.2) that supports latin1
encoding. The default, @code{Courier New}, does on our systems, as does
@code{FixedSys}.  This may be a problem in other locales, especially for
non-Western European languages.

@node The output to the console seems to be delayed, Long lines seem to be truncated., I don't see characters with accents at the R console, The R Console and Fonts
@section When using Rgui the output to the console seems to be delayed.

This is deliberate: the console output is buffered and re-written in
chunks to be less distracting. You can turn buffering off or on from
the Misc menu or the right-click menu: @key{Ctrl-W} toggles the setting.

If you are sourcing R code or writing from a function, there is another
option. A call to the R function @code{flush.console()} will write out
the buffer and so update the console.

@noindent
Now read the @file{INSTALL} file and set up all the tools needed. Then you
can just use @code{make}, sit back and wait. (A complete build takes about
15 minutes on a 300MHz PII with a fast local disc.)

You may need to compile under a case-honouring file system: we found
that a @code{samba}-mounted file system (which maps all file names to lower
case) did not work.

@node  How do I include compiled C code?, How do I debug code that I have compiled and dyn.load-ed?, How can I compile R from source?, Building from Source
@section How do I include compiled C code?

We strongly encourage you to do this @emph{via} building an R package:
see the @emph{Writing R Extensions} manual.  In any event you should
install the parts of the R system for building R packages in
@code{@RWVER@sp.zip}, and get and install the tools (including Perl) and
compilers mentioned in the file @file{readme.packages} there.  Then you
can use
@example
...\bin\Rcmd SHLIB foo.c bar.c
@end example
@noindent
to make @code{foo.dll}.  Use @code{...\bin\Rcmd SHLIB --help} for
further options, or see @code{?SHLIB}.

@section How do I debug code that I have compiled and dyn.load-ed?

First, build a version of the R system with debugging information by

@example
make clean
make DEBUG=T
@end example
@noindent

and make a debug version of your package by

@example
make pkgclean-mypkg
make DEBUG=T pkg-mypkg
@end example
@noindent

Then you can debug by

@example
gdb /path/to/@RWVER@/bin/Rgui.exe
@end example
@noindent

However, note

@itemize @bullet
@item gdb will only be able to find the source code if we run in the
location where the source was compiled (@code{@RWVER@/src/gnuwin32} for
the main system, @code{@RWVER@/src/library/mypkg/src} for a package),
unless told otherwise by the @code{directory} command. It is most
convenient to set a list of code locations via @code{directory}
commands in the file @file{.gdbinit} in the directory from which
@code{gdb} is run.

@item It is only possible to set breakpoints in a DLL after the DLL has
been loaded. So a way to examine the function @code{tukeyline} in
package @code{eda} might be

@example
     gdb ../../../../bin/Rgui.exe
     (gdb) break WinMain
     (gdb) run
     [ stops with R.dll loaded ]
     (gdb) break R_ReadConsole
     (gdb) continue
     [ stops with console running ]
     (gdb) continue
     Rconsole> library(eda)
     (gdb) break tukeyline
     (gdb) clear R_ReadConsole
     (gdb) continue
@end example

Fortran symbols need an underline appended.

@item Windows has little support for signals, so the usual idea of running a
program under a debugger and sending it a signal to interrupt it and
drop control back to the debugger does not work with @code{mingw32}
version of @code{gdb}.  It does often work with the @code{cygwin} version.

@item We have seen examples in debugging problems with Windows events that
the @code{cygwin gdb} was able to catch but which terminated the
@code{mingw32 gdb}.
@end itemize

If you have an X server available on the PC, there is a version of
@code{DDD} available that runs under the cygwin emulation layer (follow
the links at @uref{http://www.cygwin.com}) and provides a graphical user
interface to @code{gdb}.  Another (Windows-native) GUI for @code{gdb} is
@code{Insight}, part of the latest @code{cygwin} version of @code{gdb}

@section  How do I include C++ code?

You need to do two things:

(a) Write a wrapper to export the symbols you want to call from R as
 @code{extern "C"}.

(b) Include the C++ libraries in the link to make the DLL. Suppose
@file{X.cc} contains your C++ code, and @file{X_main.cc} is the wrapper,
as in the example in `@emph{Writing R Extensions}'. Then build the DLL by
(@code{gcc})

@example
...\bin\Rcmd SHLIB X.cc X_main.cc
@end example
@noindent
or (VC++, which requires extension @code{.cpp})

@example
cl /MT /c X.cpp X_main.cpp
link /dll /out:X.dll /export:X_main X.obj X_main.obj
@end example
@noindent
or (Borland C++, which also requires extension @code{.cpp})

@example
bcc32 -u- -WDE X.cpp X_main.cpp
@end example
@noindent
and call the entry point(s) in @code{X_R}, such as @code{X_main}.
Construction of static variables will occur when the DLL is loaded, and
destruction when the DLL is unloaded, usually when R terminates.

Note that you will not see the messages from this example in the GUI
console: see the next section.

This example is in package @code{cxx_0.0-x.tar.gz} in the
@file{src/contrib/Devel} section on CRAN, and that can be compiled as
package in the usual way on Windows.


@node  The output from my C code disappears., The output from my Fortran code disappears., How do I include C++ code?, Building from Source
@section  The output from my C code disappears. Why?

The @code{Rgui.exe} console is a Windows application: writing to
@code{stdout} or @code{stderr} will not produce output in the
console. (This will work with @code{Rterm.exe}.)  Use @code{Rprintf} or
@code{REprintf} instead. These are declared in header file
@file{R_ext/PrtUtil.h}.

Note that output from the console is delayed (@pxref{The output to the
console seems to be delayed}), so that you will not normally see any
output before returning to the R prompt.

@node  The output from my Fortran code disappears., The console freezes when my compiled code is running, The output from my C code disappears., Building from Source
@section  The output from my Fortran code disappears. Why?

Writing to Fortran output writes to a file, not the @code{Rgui} console.
Use one of the subroutines @code{dblepr}, @code{intpr} or @code{realpr}
documented in the @emph{`Writing R Extensions'} manual.

@section The console freezes when my compiled code is running.

The console, pagers and graphics window all run in the same thread
as the R engine.  To allow the console etc to respond to Windows events,
call @code{R_ProcessEvents()} periodically from your compiled code.
If you want output to be updated on the console, call
@code{R_FlushConsole()} and then @code{R_ProcessEvents()}.

Yes, we know that for example @code{Rcmd check} can fail with some
versions of Perl on some 16-bit Windows installations.  Usually there are
alternatives such as @code{make pkgcheck-foo}, but you could try getting
a modern operating system!
