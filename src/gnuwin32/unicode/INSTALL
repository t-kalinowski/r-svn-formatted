For UTF-8 support in Win9x and WinME, R needs a Unicode
support layer.  

Microsoft released MSLU in 2001; see these pages for details:

    http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/dev/mslu_announce.mspx
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/nettop.asp?page=/msdnmag/issues/01/10/MSLU/MSLU.asp&ad=ads.ddj.com/msdnmag/premium.htm

Unfortunately, the license for MSLU is incompatible with the GPL under
which R is released, so R is distributed with the Opencow library
instead.  See

    http://opencow.sourceforge.net
    
We use the statically linked library libunicows to import the Unicode
functions from opencows.dll (or from MSLU's unicows.dll, if it is
present).  See

    http://libunicows.sourceforge.net

INSTALLATION

Obtain a current binary version of opencow.dll from
http://opencow.sourceforge.net or from
http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools.  Obtain a current binary
version of libunicows from http://libunicows.sourceforge.net or from
http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools.  Install opencow.dll in this
directory (src/gnuwin32/unicode), and install libunicows.a in the lib
directory of your MinGW installation.

Define the variable SUPPORT_UTF8 in src/gnuwin32/MkRules, and build R.

LIMITATIONS

This library allows Unicode executables to run, but it doesn't provide
full Unicode support.  In particular:
