  This is the Info-ZIP file COPYING (for UnZip), last updated 14 Apr 2000.
__________________________________________________________________________

   FIRST NOTE:
   This file contains some details about the copyright history of
   contributions to the UnZip project.
   Additionally, it summarises some exceptions to the general BSD-like
   copyright found in LICENSE that covers our generic code and most of
   the system specific ports.
   Please read LICENSE first to find out what is allowed to do with
   Info-ZIP's UnZip code.

   There are currently four explicit copyrights on portions of UnZip
   code (at least, of which Info-ZIP is aware):  the original Sam Smith
   copyright on unzip 2.0, upon which Info-ZIP's UnZip 3.0 was based
   (now only applicable to the code for the unreduce extraction method);
   Norbert Pueschel's copyright on the Amiga time.lib code; Jim
   Luther's Mac OS File Manager interface code; and Christopher Evans'
   MacBinaryIII coding code (for the MacOS port)..  These copyrights
   are discussed in more detail below.

   All remaining code is now (starting with UnZip version 5.41) covered
   by the new Info-ZIP license. For details, please read the acompaning
   file LICENSE. The terms and conditions in this license supersede the
   copyright conditions of the contributions by Igor Mandrichenko
   (vms/vms.c), Greg Roelofs (zipinfo.c, new version of unshrink.c),
   Mike White (Windows DLL code in "windll/*"), Steve P. Miller (Pocket
   UnZip GUI "wince/*"), and Mark Adler (inflate/explode decompresseion
   core routines, previously put into the public domain). All these
   Info-ZIP contributors (or "primary" authors) have permitted us to
   replace their copyright notes by the Info-ZIP License.

   Frequently Asked Questions regarding (re)distribution of Zip and UnZip
   are near the end of this file.

   There are no known patents on any of the code in UnZip.  Unisys
   claims a patent on LZW encoding and on LZW decoding _in an apparatus
   that performs LZW encoding_, but the patent appears to exempt a stand-
   alone decoder (as in UnZip's unshrink.c).  Unisys has publicly claimed
   otherwise, but the issue has never been tested in court.  Since this
   point is unclear, unshrinking is not enabled by default.  It is the
   responsibility of the user to make his or her peace with Unisys and
   its licensing requirements.  (unshrink.c may be removed from future
   releases altogether.)
__________________________________________________________________________

   The original unzip source code has been extensively modified and
   almost entirely rewritten (changes include random zipfile access
   rather than sequential; replacement of unimplode() with explode();
   replacement of old unshrink() with new (unrelated) unshrink(); re-
   placement of output routines; addition of inflate(), wildcards,
   filename-mapping, text translation, ...; etc.).  As far as we can
   tell, the only remaining code that is substantially similar to
   Mr. Smith's is that in the file unreduce.c, which now by default
   is NOT compiled.  The following copyright applies to unreduce.c:

     * Copyright 1989 Samuel H. Smith;  All rights reserved
     *
     * Do not distribute modified versions without my permission.
     * Do not remove or alter this notice or any other copyright notice.
     * If you use this in your own program you must distribute source code.
     * Do not use any of this in a commercial product.

   Regarding the first stipulation, Mr. Smith was tracked down in southern
   California some years back [Samuel H. Smith, The Tool Shop; as of mid-
   May 1994, (213) 851-9969 (voice), (213) 887-2127(?) (subscription BBS),
   71150.2731@compuserve.com]:

   "He says that he thought that whoever contacted him understood that
    he has no objection to the Info-ZIP group's inclusion of his code.
    His primary concern is that it remain freely distributable, he said."

   Despite the fact that our "normal" code has been entirely rewritten
   and by default no longer contains any of Mr. Smith's code, Info-ZIP
   remains indebted and grateful to him.  We hope he finds our contribu-
   tions as useful as we have his.

   Note that the third and fourth stipulations still apply to any com-
   pany that wishes to incorporate the unreduce code into its products;
   if you wish to do so, you must contact Mr. Smith directly regarding
   licensing.


   The following copyright applies to the Amiga time code (amiga/time_lib.c),
   distributed with UnZip version 5.32 and later:

     * This source is copyrighted by Norbert Pueschel,
     *   <pueschel@imsdd.meb.uni-bonn.de>.
     * From 'clockdaemon.readme' (available from Aminet, including
     *   ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/util/time/clockdaemon.lha):
     * "The original SAS/C functions gmtime, localtime, mktime and time
     * do not work correctly. The supplied link library time.lib contains
     * replacement functions for them."
     * Permission is granted to the Info-ZIP group to redistribute the
     * time.lib source.  The use of time.lib functions in own, noncommercial
     * programs is permitted.  It is only required to add the timezone.doc
     * to such a distribution.  Using the time.lib library in commercial
     * software (including shareware) is only permitted after prior
     * consultation of the author.

   These license terms restrict reuse of the UnZip port on Amiga to
   noncommercial projects (or you have to replace the time handling
   code by another implementation).


   The following copyright applies to the Mac OS File Manager interface code
   (macos/source/macstuff.[ch]), distributed with UnZip 5.4 and later:

     * MoreFiles
     *
     * A collection of File Manager and related routines
     *
     * by Jim Luther (Apple Macintosh Developer Technical Support Emeritus)
     * with significant code contributions by Nitin Ganatra
     * (Apple Macintosh Developer Technical Support Emeritus)
     * Copyright  1992-1998 Apple Computer, Inc.
     * Portions copyright  1995 Jim Luther
     * All rights reserved.
     * The Package "More Files" is distributed under the following
     * license terms:
     *
     *          "You may incorporate this sample code into your
     *           applications without restriction, though the
     *           sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the
     *           responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.
     *           However, what you are not permitted to do is to
     *           redistribute the source as "DSC Sample Code" after
     *           having made changes. If you're going to
     *           redistribute the source, we require that you make
     *           it clear in the source that the code was descended
     *           from Apple Sample Code, but that you've made
     *           changes."

   The usage terms of this copyright note seem to be compatible with the
   Info-ZIP license, they do not add more restrictions.


   The following copyright applies to the Mac OS "macbin3" decoding code
   (extra field compatibility with ZipIt):

     *  MacBinaryIII.h
     *
     *  Copyright 1997 Christopher Evans (cevans@poppybank.com)
     *
     *  Basic encoding and decoding of Macintosh files to the
     *  MacBinary III spec.

   The remaining code was written by many people associated with the
   Info-ZIP group, with large contributions from (but not limited to):
   Greg Roelofs (overall program logic, ZipInfo, unshrink, filename
   mapping/portability, etc.), Mark Adler (inflate, explode, funzip),
   Kai Uwe Rommel (OS/2), John Bush and Paul Kienitz (Amiga), Antoine
   Verheijen (Macintosh), Hunter Goatley (more VMS), Mike White (Windows
   DLLs), Christian Spieler (overall logic, optimization, VMS, etc.) and
   others.  See the file CONTRIBS in the source distribution for a much
   more complete list of contributors.
   The decompression core code for the deflate method (inflate.[ch],
   explode.c) was originally written by Mark Adler who submitted it
   as public domain code.
