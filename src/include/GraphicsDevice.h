/**************************
 * A first hack at a possible new device API
 **************************
 */

/* New device driver structure
 * NOTES:
 * 1. All locations and dimensions are in device coordinates.
 * 2. I found this comment in the doc for dev_Open -- looks nasty
 *    Any known instances of such a thing happening?  Should be
 *    replaced by a function to query the device for preferred gpars
 *    settings? (to be called when the device is initialised)
         *
         * NOTE that it is perfectly acceptable for this	
         * function to set generic graphics parameters too	
         * (i.e., override the generic parameter settings	
         * which GInit sets up) all at the author's own risk	
         * of course :)						
	 *
 * 3. Do we really need dev_StrWidth as well as dev_MetricInfo?
 *    I can see the difference between the two -- its just a 
 *    question of whether dev_MetricInfo should just return
 *    what dev_StrWidth would give if font metric information is
 *    not available.  I guess having both allows the developer
 *    to decide when to ask for which sort of value, and to decide
 *    what to do when font metric information is not available.
 *    And why not a dev_StrHeight?
 * 4. Replaced dev_Resize with dev_Size
 * 5. Do I make "cex" and "ps" part of the graphics engine or
 *    part of R base graphics?  If not part of the graphics engine,
 *    then how should the graphics engine specify text size?
 *    For now, they are part of the graphics engine.
 *    Similar comments apply for "font".
 * 6. Should "ipr", "asp", and "cra" be in the device description?
 *    If not, then where?
 *    I guess they don't need to be if no device makes use of them.
 *    On the other hand, they would need to be replaced by a device
 *    call that R base graphics could use to get enough information
 *    to figure them out.  (e.g., some sort of dpi() function to
 *    complement the size() function.)
 * 7. Is dev_Dot used anywhere?
