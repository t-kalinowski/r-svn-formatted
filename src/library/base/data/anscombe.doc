ANSCOMBE - Anscombe's Quartet of ``Identical'' Simple Linear Regressions


DESCRIPTION

Four x-y datasets which have the same traditional statistical properties
(mean, variance, correlation, regression line, etc.), yet are quite
different.


FORMAT

A data frame with 11 observations on 8 variables.

 x1 == x2 == x3 (the integers 4:14, specially arranged)
 x4 : values 8 and 19.

 y1, y2, y3, y4:  numbers in (3, 12.5); mean(y<j>) = 7.5 and st.dev = 2.03
