ATTENU - The Joyner-Boore Attenuation Data

DESCRIPTION

This data gives peak accelerations measured at various observation
stations for 23 earthquakes in California. The data have been used
by various workers to estimate the attenuating affect of distance
on ground acceleration.


FORMAT

A dataframe with 182 observations on 5 variables.

  [,1]	event    numeric  Event Number
  [,2]	mag      numeric  Moment Magnitude
  [,3]	station  factor   Station Number
  [,4]	dist     numeric  Station-hypocenter distance (km)
  [,5]	accel    numeric  Peak acceleration (g)
