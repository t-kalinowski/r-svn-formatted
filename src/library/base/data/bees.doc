BEES - Potency of Orchard Sprays

DESCRIPTION

An experiment was conducted to assess the potency of various constituents
of orchard sprays in repelling honeybees.  Individual cells of dry comb
were filled with measured amounts of lime sulphur emulsion in sucrose
solution.  Seven different concentrations of lime sulphur ranging from
a concentration of 1/100 to 1/1,562,500 in succesive factors of 1/5 were
used as well as a solution containing no lime sulphur.

The responses for the different solutions were obtained by releasing
100 bees into the chamber for two hours, and then measuring the decrease
in volume of the solutions in the various cells.

An 8x8 Latin Square design was used and the treatments were coded as
follows:

	A = highest level of lime sulphur
	B = next highest level of lime sulphur
	  .
	  .
	  .
	G = lowest level of lime sulphur
	H = no lime sulphur

FORMAT
