SAVINGS - Intercountry Life-Cycle Savings Data

DESCRIPTION

Under the life-cycle savings hypothesis as developed by Franco
Modigliani, the savings ratio (aggregate personal saving divided
by disposable income is explained by per-capita disposable income,
the percentage rate of change in per-capita disposable income, and
two demographic variables: the percentage of population less than
15 years old and the percentage of the population over 75 years
old.  The data are averaged over the decade 1960-1970 to remove
the business cycle or other short-term fluctuations.
