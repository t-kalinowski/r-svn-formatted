STACKLOSS - Brownlee's Stack Loss Plant Data

DESCRIPTION

(Brownlee, cited by Dodge, slightly reformatted by MM):
``Obtained from 21 days of operation of a plant for the oxidation
 of ammonia (NH_3) to nitric acid (HNO_3).
 The nitric oxides produced are absorbed in a countercurrent absorption tower.
 _x1_ represents the rate of operation of the plant.
 _x2_ is the temperature of cooling water circulated through coils in the
      absorption tower.
 _x3_ is the concentration of the acid circulating,
      minus 50, times 10: that is, 89 corresponds to 58.9 per cent acid.
 _y_  (the dependent variable) is 10 times the percentage of the ingoing
      ammonia to the plant that escapes from the absorption column
      unabsorbed; that is, an (inverse) measure of the over-all efficiency
      of the plant.''
