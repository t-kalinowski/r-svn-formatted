\title{Report Information on C Stack Size and Usage}
\description{
  Report information on the C stack size and usage (if available).
}
\usage{
Cstack_info()
}
\details{
  On most platforms, C stack information is recorded when \R is
  initialized and used for stack-checking.  If this information is
  unavailable, the \code{size} will be returned as \code{-1}, and
  stack-checking is not performed.

  The information on the base address is thought to be accurate on
  Windows, Linux and FreeBSD (including MacOS X), but a heuristic is
  used on other platforms.  Because this might be slightly inaccurate,
  the current usage could be estimated as negative.
}
\value{
  An integer vector.  This has named elements
  \item{size}{The size of the stack (in bytes), or \code{NA} if unknown.}
  \item{current}{The estimated current usage (in bytes), possibly \code{NA}.}
  \item{direction}{\code{1} (stack grows down, the usual case) or
    \code{-1} (stack grows up).}
  \item{eval_depth}{The current evaluation depth (including two calls
    for the call to \code{Cstack_info}).}
