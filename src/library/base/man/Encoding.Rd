\title{Read or Set the Declared Encodings for a Character Vector}
\description{
  Read or set the declared encodings for a character vector.
}
\usage{
Encoding(x)

Encoding(x) <- value
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{A character vector.}
  \item{value}{A character vector of positive length.}
}
\details{
  As from \R 2.5.0, character strings in \R can be declared to be in
  \code{"latin1"} or \code{"UTF-8"}.  These declarations can be read by
  \code{Encoding}, which will return a character vector of values
  \code{"latin1"}, \code{"UTF-8"} or \code{"unknown"}, or set, when
  \code{value} is recycled as needed and other values are silently
  treated as \code{"unknown"}.
}
\value{
  A character vector.
}
\examples{
## x is intended to be in latin1
x <- "fa\xE7ile"
Encoding(x)
Encoding(x) <- "latin1"
x
if(capabilities("iconv")) {
  xx <- iconv(x, "latin1", "UTF-8")
  print(Encoding(c(x, xx)))
  c(x, xx)
}
