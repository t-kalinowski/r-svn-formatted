abline(a, b, \dots)

\description{
  This function adds one or more straight lines through the current plot.
  The first form above specifies the line in intercept/slope form
  (alternatively \code{a} can be specified on its own and is taken to
  contain the slope and intercept in vector form).
  The \code{h=} and \code{v=} forms draw horizontal and vertical lines
  at the specified coordinates.
  The \code{coef} form specifies the line by a vector containing the
  slope and intercept.
  \code{reg} is a regression object which contains \code{reg$coef}.  If
  it is of length 1 then the value is taken to be the slope of a line
  through the origin, otherwise, the first 2 values are taken to be the
  slope and intercept.
  
  If \code{untf} is true, and one or both axes are log-transformed, then
  a curve is drawn corresponding to a line in original coordinates,
  otherwise a line is drawn in the transformed coordinate system. The
  \code{h} and \code{v} parameters alway refer to original coordinates. 
  
  The graphical parameters \code{col} and \code{lty} can be specified as
  arguments to \code{abline}; see \code{par} for details.
