\usage{
attach(what, pos = 2, name = deparse(substitute(what)))
}
\alias{attach}
\arguments{
  \item{what}{\dQuote{database}.  This may currently be a
    \code{data.frame} or \code{list} or a \R data file created with
    \code{\link{save}}.}
  \item{pos}{integer specifying position in \code{\link{search}()} where
    to attach.}
  \item{name}{alternative way to specify the database to be attached.}
}
\description{
  The database is attached to the \R search path.  This means that the
  database is searched by \R when evaluating a variable, so objects in
  the database can be accessed by simply giving their names.}

\details{
  When evaluating a variable or function name \R searches for
  that name in the databases listed by \code{\link{search}}.  The first
  name of the appropriate type is used.

  By attaching a data frame to the search path it is possible to refer
  to the variables in the data frame by their names alone, rather than
  as components of the data frame (eg in the example below,
  \code{height} rather than \code{women$height}).

  By default the database is attached in position 2 in the search path,
  immediately after the user's workspace and before all previously
  loaded packages and previously attached databases. This can be altered
  to attach later in the search path with the \code{pos} option, but you
  cannot attach at \code{pos=1}.

  The database is not actually attached.  Rather, a new environment is
  created on the search path and the elements of a list (including columns
  of a dataframe) or objects in a save file are \emph{copied} into the
  new environment.  If you use \code{\link{<<-}} or \code{\link{assign}}
  to assign to an attached database, you only alter the attached copy,
  not the original object.  (Normal assignment will place a modified
  version in the user's workspace: see the examples.)
  For this reason \code{attach} can lead to confusion.

  One useful \sQuote{trick} is to use \code{what = NULL} (or equivalently a
  length-zero list) to create a new environment on the search path into
  which objects can be assigned by \code{\link{assign}} or
  \code{\link{sys.source}}.
}
\value{
  The \code{\link{environment}} is returned invisibly with a
  \code{"name"} attribute.
