chisq.test(x, y = NULL, correct = TRUE, 
           p = rep(1/length(x), length(x)))
}
\alias{chisq.test}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a vector or matrix.}
  \item{y}{a vector; ignored if \code{x} is a matrix.}
  \item{correct}{a logical indicating whether to apply continuity
    correction when computing the test statistic.} 
}
\description{
  \code{chisq.test} performs chi-square tests on contingency tables.

  If \code{x} is a matrix with one row or column, or if \code{x} is a
  vector and \code{y} is not given, \code{x} is treated as a
  one-dimensional contingency table.  In this case, the hypothesis
  tested is whether the population probabilities equal those in
  \code{p}, or are all equal if \code{p} is not given.

  If \code{x} is a matrix with at least two rows and columns, it is
  taken as a two-dimensional contingency table, and hence its entries
  should be nonnegative integers.  Otherwise, \code{x} and \code{y} must
  be vectors or factors of the same length;  incomplete cases are
  removed, the objects are coerced into factor objects, and the
  contingency table is computed from these.  Then, Pearson's chi-square
  test of the null that the joint distribution of the cell counts in a
  2-dimensional contigency table is the product of the row and column
  marginals is performed.  Continuity correction is only used in the
  2-by-2 case if \code{correct} is \code{TRUE}.
