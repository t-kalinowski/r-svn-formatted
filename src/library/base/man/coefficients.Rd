\arguments{
  \item{x}{an object for which the extraction of model coefficients is
    meaningful.}
  \item{\dots}{other arguments.}
}
\value{
  Coefficients extracted from the model object \code{x}.
}
\description{
  \code{coef} is a generic function which extracts model coefficents
  from objects returned by modeling functions.  \code{coefficients} is
  an alias for it.

  All object classes which are returned by model fitting functions
  should provide a \code{coef} method.  (Note that method is `coef' and
  not `coefficients'.)
