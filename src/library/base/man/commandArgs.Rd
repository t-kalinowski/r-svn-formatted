\usage{
commandArgs()
}
%- maybe also `usage' for other objects documented here.
\description{
  provides access to a copy of the command line
  arguments supplied when this R session was invoked.
}
\details{
  These arguments are captured before the standard
  R command line processing takes place. This means
  that they are the unmodified values.
  If it were useful, we could provide support an argument
  which indicated whether we want the unprocessed or processed values.
}
\value{
  A character vector containing the name of the
  executable and the user-supplied command line arguments.
  The first element is the name of the executable by which R was
  invoked. As far as I am aware, the exact form of this is element
  is platform dependent. It may be the fully qualified name, or simply
  the last component (or basename) of the application.
