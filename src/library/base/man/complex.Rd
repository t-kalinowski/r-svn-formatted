\description{
These are basic functions which support complex arithmetic in R.
Complex vectors can be created with \code{complex}.
The vector can be specified either by giving its length,
or its real and imaginary parts (or both).

Note that \code{is.complex} and \code{is.numeric} are never both \code{TRUE}.

The functions \code{Re}, \code{Im}, \code{Mod}, \code{Arg} and \code{Conj}
have their usual interpretation as returning the real part,
imaginary part, modulus, argument and complex conjugate for
complex values.
In addition, the elementary trigonometric, logarithmic and
exponential functions are available for complex values.

\examples{
# create a complex normal vector
z <- complex(real=rnorm(100), imag=rnorm(100))
# or also (less efficiently):
z2 <- 1:2 + 1i*(8:9)
}
