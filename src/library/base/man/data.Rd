\title{Data Sets}
\description{
  Loads specified data sets, or list the available data sets.
}
\usage{
data(\dots, list = character(0), package = .packages(),
     lib.loc = NULL, verbose = getOption("verbose"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{\dots}{a sequence of names or character strings.}
  \item{list}{a character vector.}
  \item{package}{a name or character vector giving the packages to look
    into for data sets.  By default, all packages in the search path are
    used, then the \file{data} directory (if present) of the current
    working directory.}
  \item{lib.loc}{a character vector of directory names of \R libraries,
    or \code{NULL}.  The default value of \code{NULL} corresponds to all
    libraries currently known.  If the default is used, the loaded
    packages are searched before the libraries.}
  \item{verbose}{a logical.  If \code{TRUE}, additional diagnostics are
    printed.}
}
\value{
  a character vector of all data sets specified, or information about
  all available data sets in an object of class \code{"packageIQR"} if
  none were specified.
}
\details{
  Currently, four formats of data files are supported:

  \enumerate{
    \item files ending \file{.RData} or \file{.rda} are
    \code{\link{load}()}ed.

    \item files ending \file{.R} or \file{.r} are
    \code{\link{source}()}d in, with the \R working directory changed
    temporarily to the directory containing the respective file.

    \item files ending \file{.tab}, \file{.txt} or \file{.TXT} are read using
    \code{\link{read.table}(\dots, header = TRUE)}, and hence result in
    a data frame.

    \item files ending \file{.csv} or \file{.CSV} are read using
    \code{\link{read.table}(\dots, header = TRUE, sep = ";")},
    and also result in a data frame.
  }
  If more than one matching file name is found, the first on this list
  is used.
  
  The data sets to be loaded can be specified as a sequence of names or
  character strings, or as the character vector \code{list}, or as both.

  If no data sets are specified, \code{data} lists the available data
  sets.  It looks for a file \file{00Index} in a \file{data} directory
  of each specified package, and uses these files to prepare a listing.
  If there is a \file{data} area but no index a warning is given: such
  packages are incomplete.  The information about available data sets is
  returned in an object of class \code{"packageIQR"}.  The structure of
  this class is experimental.  In earlier versions of R, an empty
  character vector was returned along with listing available data sets.

  If \code{lib.loc} is not specified,  the datasets are searched for
  amongst those packages already loaded, followed by the \file{data}
  directory (if any) of the current working directory and then packages
  in the specified libraries.  If \code{lib.loc} \emph{is} specified,
  packages are searched for in the specified libraries, even if they are
  already loaded from another library.

  To just look in the \file{data} directory of the current working
  directory, set \code{package = NULL}.
}
\note{
  The data files can be many small files.  On some file systems it is
  desirable to save space, and the files in the \file{data} directory of
  an installed package can be zipped up as a zip archive
  \file{Rdata.zip}.  You will need to provide a single-column file
  \file{filelist} of file names in that directory.

  One can take advantage of the search order and the fact that a
  \file{.R} file will change directory.  If raw data are stored in
  \file{mydata.txt} then one can set up \file{mydata.R} to read
  \file{mydata.txt} and pre-process it, e.g. using \code{transform}.
  For instance one can convert numeric vectors to factors with the
  appropriate labels.  Thus, the \file{.R} file can effectively contain
  a metadata specification for the plaintext formats.

  \code{\link{save}} for \emph{creating} the first (\file{.rda}) kind of
  data, typically the most efficient one.

data()                      # list all available data sets
data(package = base)        # list the data sets in the base package
