\description{
These functions set and unset the debugging flag on a function.
When a function flagged for debugging is entered, normal execution
is suspended and the body of function is executed on statement at a time.
A new browser context is initiated for each step (and the previous one
destroyed).
Currently you can only debug functions that have bodies enclosed in braces.
This is a bug and will be fixed soon.
You take the next step by typing carriage return, \code{n} or \code{next}.
You can see the values of variables by typing their names.
Typing \code{c} or \code{cont} causes the debugger to continue to the
end of the function.
You can \code{debug} new functions before you step in to them from inside
the debugger.
If you have variables with names that are identical to the controls
(eg. \code{c} or \code{n} ) then you need to use \code{print(c)} and
\code{print(n)} to evaluate them.
