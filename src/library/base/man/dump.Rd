\title{Text Representations of R Objects}
\usage{
dump(list, file = "dumpdata.R", append = FALSE, envir = parent.frame())
}
\alias{dump}
\description{
  This function takes a vector of names of \R objects and produces
  text representations of the objects on a file or connection.
  A \code{dump} file can usually be \code{\link{source}}d into another
  \R (or S) session.
}
\arguments{
  \item{list}{character. The names of one or more \R objects to be dumped.}

  \item{file}{either a character string naming a file or a
    connection. \code{""} indicates output to the console.}

  \item{append}{if \code{TRUE}, output will be appended to
    \code{file}; otherwise, it will overwrite the contents of
    \code{file}.}

  \item{envir}{the environment to search for objects.}
}
\details{
  At present \code{source}ing may not produce an identical copy of 
  \code{dump}ed objects. A warning is issued if it is likely 
  that major differences will be present, for example when dumping uncommon
  objects such as \link[delay]{promises}, \link[environment]{environments},
  external pointers, etc.

  \code{dump} will also warn if fewer characters were written to a file than
  expected, which may indicate a full or corrupt file system.

  A \code{dump} file can be \code{\link{source}}d into another \R (or
  perhaps S) session, but the function \code{\link{save}} is designed to
  be used for transporting \R data, and will work with \R objects that
  \code{dump} does not handle.
  
  To produce a more readable representation of an object (though perhaps
  a less faithful representation), use \code{\link{dput}}.
}
\note{
  The \code{envir} argument was added at version 1.7.0, and changed the
  default search path for named objects to include the environment from which
  \code{dump} was called.

  As \code{dump} is defined in the base namespace, the \pkg{base}
  package will be searched \emph{before} the global environment unless
  \code{dump} is called from the top level or the \code{envir} argument
  is given explicitly.
