\description{
  The function \code{factor} is used to encode a vector as a factor (the
  names category and enumerated type are also used for factors).  If
  \code{ordered} is \code{TRUE}, the factor levels are assumed to be ordered.
  For compatibility with S there is also a function \code{ordered}.

  \code{is.factor}, \code{is.ordered}, \code{as.factor} and \code{as.ordered}
  are the membership and coercion functions for these classes.
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a vector of data, usually taking a small number of distinct values}
  \item{levels}{an optional vector of the values that \code{x} might
    have taken. The default is the set of values taken by \code{x},
    sorted into increasing order.}
  \item{labels}{\emph{either} an optional vector of labels for the
    levels (in the same order as \code{levels} after removing those in
    \code{exclude}), \emph{or} a character string of length 1.}
  \item{exclude}{a vector of values to be excluded when forming the
    set of levels. This should be of the same type as \code{x}, and
    will be coerced if necessary.}
  \item{ordered}{logical flag to determine if the levels should be regarded
    as ordered (in the order given).}
  \item{\dots}{(in \code{ordered(.)}): any of the above, apart from
    \code{ordered} itself.}
}
\value{
  \code{factor} returns an object of class \code{"factor"} which has a
  set of numeric codes the length of \code{x} with a \code{"levels"}
  attribute of mode \code{\link{character}}.  If \code{ordered} is true
  (or \code{ordered} is used) the result has class
  \code{c("ordered", "factor")}.

  \code{is.factor} returns \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} depending on
  whether its argument is of type factor or not.  Correspondingly,
  \code{is.ordered} returns \code{TRUE} when its
  argument is ordered and \code{FALSE} otherwise.

  \code{as.factor} coerces its argument to a factor.
  It is an abbreviated form of \code{factor}.

  \code{as.ordered(x)} returns \code{x} if this is ordered, and
  \code{ordered(x)} otherwise.
}
\details{
  The type of the vector \code{x} is not restricted.

  Ordered factors differ from factors only in their class, but methods
  and the model-fitting functions treat the two classes quite differently.

  The encoding of the vector happens as follows. First all the values
  in \code{exclude} are removed from \code{levels}. If \code{x[i]} equals
  \code{levels[j]}, then the \code{i}-th element of the result is
  \code{j}.  If no match is found for \code{x[i]} in \code{levels},
  then the \code{i}-th element of the result is set to \code{\link{NA}}.

  Normally the `levels' used as an attribute of the result are the
  reduced set of levels after removing those in \code{exclude}, but
  this can be altered by supplying \code{labels}. This should either
  be a set of new labels for the levels, or a character string, in
  which case the levels are that character string with a sequence
  number appended.

  \code{factor(x, exclude=NULL)} applied to a factor is a no-operation
  unless there are unused levels: in that case, a factor with the
  reduced level set is returned.  If \code{exclude} is used it should
  also be a factor with the same level set as \code{x} or a set of codes
  for the levels to be excluded.

  The codes of a factor may contain \code{\link{NA}}. For a numeric
  \code{x}, set \code{exclude=NULL} to make \code{\link{NA}} an extra
  level (\code{"NA"}), by default the last level.

  If \code{"NA"} is a level, the way to set a code to be missing is to
  use \code{\link{is.na}} on the left-hand-side of an assignment.
  Under those circumstances missing values are printed as \code{<NA>}.

  \code{is.factor} is generic: you can write methods to handle
  of specific classes of objects, see \link{InternalMethods}.
}
\section{Warning}{
  The interpretation of a factor depends on both the codes and the
  \code{"levels"} attribute.  Be careful only to compare factors with
  the same set of levels (in the same order).  In particular,
  \code{as.numeric} applied to a factor is meaningless, and may
  happen by implicit coercion.

  The levels of a factor are by default sorted, but the sort order
  may well depend on the locale at the time of creation, and should
  not be assumed to be ASCII.
