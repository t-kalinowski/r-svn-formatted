\title{Report Time Spent in Garbage Collection}
\description{
  This function reports the time spent in garbage collection so far in
  the \R session.
}
\usage{
gc.time()
}
\value{
  A numerical vector of length 5 giving the user CPU time, the system
  CPU time, the elapsed time and children's user and system CPU times
  (normally both zero).
}
#ifdef windows
\note{
  CPU times will be returned as \code{NA} on Windows 9x/ME systems, but
  are genuine times on NT4 and 2000 systems. Times of child processes are
  not available and will always be given as \code{NA}.
}
#endif
\section{Warnings}
{
  This is experimental functionality, likely to be removed as soon as
  the next release.

  The timings are rounded up by the sampling interval for timing
  processes, and so are likely to be over-estimates.
}
\seealso{\code{\link{gc}},
  \code{\link{proc.time}} for the timings for the session.}
