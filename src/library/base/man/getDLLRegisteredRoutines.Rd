\title{Reflectance Information for C/Fortran routines in a DLL}
\description{
  This function allows us to query the set of routines
  in a DLL that are registered with R to enhance
  dynamic lookup, error handling when calling native routines,
  and potentially security in the future.
  This function provides a description of each of the
  registered routines in the DLL for the different interfaces,
  i.e. \code{\link{.C}}, \code{\link{.Call}}, \code{\link{.Fortran}}
  and \code{\link{.External}}.
}
\usage{
getDLLRegisteredRoutines(dll)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dll}{a character string or \code{DLLInfo} object (as returned by
    \code{\link{getLoadedDLLs}}).
  }
}
\details{
  This takes the registration information after it has been registered
  and processed by the R internals. In other words, it uses the extended
  information
}
\value{
  A list with four elements corresponding to the routines
  registered for the .C, .Call, .Fortran and .External interfaces.
  Each element is a list with as many elements as there were
  routines registered for that interface.
  Each element identifies a routine and is an object
  of class \code{NativeSymbolInfo}.
  An object of this class has the following fields:
  \item{name}{the registered name of the routine (not necessarily the
    name in the C code).}
  \item{address}{the memory address of the routine as resolved in the
    loaded DLL. This may be \code{NULL} if the symbol has not yet been
    resolved.}
  \item{dll}{an object of class \code{DLLInfo} describing the DLL.
    This is same for all elements returned.}
  \item{numParameters}{the number of arguments the native routine is to
    be called with. In the future, we will provide information about
    the types of the parameters also.
