\title{Obtain a description of a native (C/Fortran) symbol}
\description{
  This finds and returns as comprehensive a description of a
  dynamically loaded or \dQuote{exported} built-in native
  symbol. It returns information about the
  name of the symbol, the library in which it is located
  and, if available, the number of arguments it expects
  and by which interface it should be called (i.e
  \code{\link{.Call}},   \code{\link{.C}},
  \code{\link{.Fortran}},  or \code{\link{.External}}).
  Additionally, it returns the address of the symbol and this
  can be passed to other C routines which can invoke.
  Specifically, this provides a way to explicitly share
  symbols between different dynamically loaded package libraries.
  Also, it provides a way to query where symbols were resolved,
  and aids diagnosing strange behavior associated with dynamic
  resolution.

\usage{
getNativeSymbolInfo(name, PACKAGE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{name}{the name of the native symbol as used in a call
    to \code{\link{is.loaded}}, etc.  Note that Fortran symbols should be
    supplied as-is, not wrapped in \code{symbol.For}.
  }
  \item{PACKAGE}{an optional argument that specifies to which
    dynamically loaded library we restrict the search for this symbol.
    If this is \code{"base"}, we search in the R executable itself.}
}
\details{
  This uses the same mechanism for resolving symbols as is used
  in all the native interfaces (\code{\link{.Call}}, etc.).
  If the symbol has been explicitly registered by the shared library
  in which it is contained, information about the number of arguments
  and the interface by which it should be called will be returned.
  Otherwise, a generic native symbol object is returned.
}
\value{
  If the symbol is not found, an error is raised.
  Otherwise, the value is a list containing the following elements:
  \item{name}{the name of the symbol, as given by the
  \code{name} argument.}
  \item{address}{the native memory address of the symbol which can
    be used to invoke the routine, and also
    compare with other symbol address. This is an external pointer
    object and of class \code{NativeSymbol}.}
  \item{package}{a list containing 3 elements:
    \describe{
      \item{name}{the short form of the library name which can be used
	as the value of the \code{PACKAGE} argument in
	the different native interface functions.}
      \item{path}{the fully qualified name of the shared library file.}
      \item{dynamicLookup}{a logical value indicating whether dynamic
	resolution is used when looking for symbols in this library,
	or only registered routines can be located.}
    }    
  }
  The class of this list object is \code{NativeSymbolInfo}.
  If the routine was explicitly registered by the dynamically
  loaded library, the list contains a fourth field
  \item{numParameters}{the number of arguments that should be passed
    in a call to this routine.}
  Additionally, the list will have an additional class,
  being \code{CRoutine},   \code{CallRoutine},
  \code{FortranRoutine} or \code{ExternalRoutine}
  corresponding to the R interface by which it should be invoked.

\note{
  One motivation for accessing this reflectance information
  is to be able to pass native routines to 
  C routines as \dQuote{function pointers} in C.
  This allows us to treat native routines and R functions
  in a similar manner, such as when passing an R function
  to C code that makes callbacks to that function
  at different points in its computation
  (e.g., \code{\link{nls}}).
  Additionally, we can resolve the symbol just once and
  avoid resolving it repeatedly or using the internal
  cache.
  In the future, one may be able to treat \code{NativeSymbol}
  objects directly as callback objects.
