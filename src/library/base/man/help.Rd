\arguments{
 \item{topic}{a name or character string on which documentation is
   sought (but \emph{not} a variable containing a character string!).}
 \item{offline}{a logical indicating whether documentation should be
   displayed on-line to the screen (the default) or hardcopy of it
   should be produced.}
 \item{package}{a name or character vector giving the packages to look
  into for documentation.  By default, all packages in the search path
  are used.}
 \item{lib.loc}{A character vector of directory names of \R libraries.
  Defaults to all libraries currently known.}
 \item{verbose}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, the file name is reported.}
 \item{htmlhelp}{logical (or \code{NULL}).  If \code{TRUE} (is the
     default after \code{\link{help.start}} has been called), the help
     will not be shown on the console, but via the html browser.}
}
\description{
  These functions provide access to documentation.
  Documentation on a topic with name \code{name} (typically, an \R
  object or a data set) can be printed with either \code{help(name)} or
  \code{?name}.
  In the case of unary and binary operators and control-flow special
  forms, the name may need to be be quoted.

  If \code{offline} is \code{TRUE}, hardcopy of the documentation is
  produced by running the LaTeX version of the help page through
  \code{latex} (note that LaTeX 2e is needed) and \code{dvips}.
  Depending on your \code{dvips} configuration, hardcopy will be sent to
  the printer or saved in a file.  If the programs are in non-standard
  locations and hence were not found at compile time, you need to set
  the environment variables \code{LATEX} and \code{DVIPS} appropriately.
  The appearance of the output can be customized through a file
  \file{Rhelp.cfg} somewhere in your LaTeX search path.
