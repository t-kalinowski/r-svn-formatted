\description{
These functions provide online access to documentation. 
Documentation on a topic with name \code{name} (typically, an R object or
a data set) can be printed on-screen with either \code{help(name)} or
\code{?name}.
In the case of unary and binary operators and control-flow special
forms, the name may need to be be quoted.
