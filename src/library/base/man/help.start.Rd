\details{
#ifdef unix
  All the packages in the known library trees are linked to a directory
  \code{.R} in the user's home directory.

  The \code{browser} needs to work with a \code{"-remote openURL(...)"}
  call. Then, the hypertext \R help interface is opened in any already
  running browser or a new one if necessary.  Browsers that support this
  interface include Netscape 4.x, 6.2.x (but not 6.0/1), Opera 5/6 and
  Mozilla >= 0.9.5.

  If the browser given by the \code{browser} argument is different from
  the default browser as specified by \code{options("browser")}, the
  default is changed to the given browser so that it gets used for all
  future help requests.
#endif
#ifdef windows
  The Windows file association mechanism is used to send the HTML file
  to a browser, launching one if necessary.

  Unlike Unix systems, running \code{help.start} does not send all
  future help requests to the browser: use \code{options(htmlhelp=TRUE)}
  to set that.

  Alternatively, a specific browser can be started if \code{browser} is
  specified, but \code{help} will still use the file association mechanism.

  \code{help.start} and the Java-based search engine have been tested
  under Internet Explorer 6, Netscape 6.2.2, Opera 6.01 and Mozilla 0.9.9.
