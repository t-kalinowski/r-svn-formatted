\title{Convert Character Vector between Encodings}
\description{
  This uses system facilities to convert a character vector between
  encodings: the \sQuote{i} stands for \sQuote{internationalization}.
}
\usage{
iconv(x, from ="", to = "", sub=NA)

iconvlist()
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{A character vector, or an object to be converted to a character
    vector by \code{\link{as.character}}.}
  \item{from}{A character string describing the current encoding.}
  \item{to}{A character string describing the target encoding.}
  \item{sub}{character string.  If not \code{NA} it is used to replace
    any non-convertible bytes in the input.  (This would normally be a
    single character, but can be more.)  If \code{"byte"}, the indication is
    \code{"<xx>"} with the hex code of the byte.}
}

\details{
  The names of encodings and which ones are available (and indeed, if
  any are) is platform-dependent.  On all systems that support
  \code{iconv} you can use \code{""} for the encoding of the current
  locale, as well as \code{"latin1"} and \code{"UTF-8"}.

#ifdef unix
  On many platforms \code{iconvlist} provides an alphabetical list of
  the supported encodings.  On others, the information is on the man
  page for \code{iconv(5)} or elsewhere in the man pages (and beware
  that the system command \code{iconv} may not support the same set of
  encodings as the C functions \R calls).
  Unfortunately, the names are rarely common across platforms.

#ifdef windows
  \code{iconvlist} provides an alphabetical list of the supported encodings.
#endif

  Elements of \code{x} which cannot be converted (perhaps because they
  are invalid or because they cannot be represented in the target
  encoding) will be returned as \code{NA} unless \code{sub} is specified.

  Some versions of \code{iconv} will allow transliteration by appending
  \code{//TRANSLIT} to the \code{to} encoding: see the examples.
}
\value{
  A character vector of the same length and the same attributes as
  \code{x} (after conversion).

  The elements of the result have a declared encoding if \code{from} is
  \code{"latin1"} or \code{"UTF-8"}, or if \code{from = ""} and the
  current locale's charset is detected as Latin-1 or UTF-8.
}
\note{
  Not all platforms support these functions.  See also
  \code{\link{capabilities}("iconv")}.
