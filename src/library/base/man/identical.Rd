\title{ Test Objects for Exact Equality }
\description{
  The safe and reliable way to test two objects for being
  \emph{exactly} equal.  It returns \code{TRUE} in this case,
  \Code{FALSE} in every other case.

\usage{
identical(x, y)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x, y}{ Any R objects. }
}
\details{
 A call to \code{identical} is the way to test exact equality in
 \code{if} and \code{while} statements, as well as in logical
 expressions that use \code{&&} or \code{||}.  In all these
 applications you need to be assured of getting a single logical
 value.

 Users often use the comparison operators, such as \code{==} or
 \code{!=}, in these situations.  It looks natural, but it is not what
 these operators are designed to do in R.  They return an object like
 the arguments.  If you expected \code{x} and \code{y} to be of length
 1, but it happened that one of them wasn't, you will \emph{not} get a
 single \code{FALSE}.  Similarly, if one of the arguments is \code{NA}, the result is
 also \code{NA}.  In either case, the expression \code{if(x==y)....} won't
 work.

 The function \code{all.equal} is also sometimes used to test equality
 this way, but it was intended for something different.  First, it
 tries to allow for ``reasonable'' differences in numeric results.
 Second, it returns a descriptive character vector instead of
 \code{FALSE} when the objects do not match.  Therefore, it is not the
 right function to use for reliable testing either.  (If you \emph{do} want
 to allow for numeric fuzziness in comparing objects, you can combine
 \code{all.equal} and \code{identical}, as shown in the examples
 below.)

 The computations in \code{identical} are also reliable and usually
 fast.  There should never be an error.  The only known way to kill
 \code{identical} is by having an invalid pointer at the C level,
 generating a memory fault.  It will usually find inequality quickly.
 Checking equality for two large, complicated objects can take longer
 if the objects are identical or nearly so, but represent completely
 independent copies.  For most applications, however, the computational cost
 should be negligible.

\value{
  A single logical value, \code{TRUE} or
  \code{FALSE}, never \code{NA} and never anything other than a single value.
