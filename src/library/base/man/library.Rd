\description{
  \code{library} and \code{require} load add-on packages.
  \code{.First.lib} is called when a package is loaded;
  \code{.Last.lib} is called when a package is detached.
  \code{.packages} returns information about package availability.
  \code{.path.package} returns information about where a package was
  loaded from.
  \code{.find.package} returns the directory paths of installed
  packages.

\arguments{
  \item{package, help}{\link{name} or character string giving the name
    of a package.}
  \item{lib.loc}{a character vector describing the location of \R
    library trees to search through.}
  \item{character.only}{a logical indicating whether \code{package} or
    \code{help} can be assumed to be character strings.}
  \item{logical.return}{logical.  If it is \code{TRUE},  \code{FALSE} or
      \code{TRUE} is returned to indicate success.}
  \item{warn.conflicts}{logical.  If \code{TRUE}, warnings are
    printed about \code{\link{conflicts}} from attaching the new
    package, unless that package contains an object \code{.conflicts.OK}.}
  \item{keep.source}{logical.  If \code{TRUE}, functions ``keep their
    source'' including comments, see \code{\link{options}(keep.source = *)}.}
  \item{quietly}{a logical.  If \code{TRUE}, a warning will not be
    printed if the package cannot be found.}
  \item{libname}{a character string giving the library directory where
    the package was found.}
  \item{pkgname}{a character string giving the name of the package.}
  \item{libpath}{a character string giving the complete path to the
    package.}
  \item{all.available}{logical; if \code{TRUE} return a character vector
    of all available packages in \code{lib.loc}.}
  \item{quiet}{logical.
    For \code{.path.package}, should this not give warnings or an error
    if the package(s) are not loaded?
    For \code{.find.package}, should this not give warnings or an error
    if the package(s) are not found?}
  \item{use.attached}{a logical indicating whether attached packages
    should be considered in addition to the ones installed in the given
    libraries.}

\details{
  \code{library(package)} and \code{require(package)} both load the
  package with name \code{package}.  \code{require} is designed for use
  inside other functions; it returns \code{FALSE} and optionally gives a
  warning, rather than giving an error, if the package does not exist.
  Both functions check and update the list of currently loaded packages
  and do not reload code that is already loaded.

  For large packages, setting \code{keep.source = FALSE} may save quite
  a bit of memory.

  If \code{library} is called with no \code{package} or \code{help}
  argument, it gives a list of all available packages in \code{lib.loc}
  and invisibly returns their names (same as
  \code{.packages(all = TRUE)}).

  \code{library(help = somename)} prints information on the package
  \code{somename}, typically by listing the most important user level
  objects it contains.

  \code{.First.lib} is called when a package is loaded by
  \code{library}.  It is called with two arguments, the name of the
  library directory where the package was found (i.e., the corresponding
  element of \code{lib.loc}), and the name of the package (in that
  order).  It is a good place to put calls to \code{\link{library.dynam}}
  which are needed when loading a package into this function (don't call
  \code{library.dynam} directly, as this will not work if the package
  is not installed in a ``standard'' location).  \code{.First.lib}
  is invoked after the search path interrogated by \code{search()}
  has been updated, so
  \code{pos.to.env(match("package:name"), search())} will return the
  environment in which the package is stored.  If calling
  \code{.First.lib} gives an error the loading of the package is
  abandoned, and the package will be unavailable.  Similarly, if the
  option \code{".First.lib"} has a list element with the package's name,
  this element is called in the same manner as \code{.First.lib} when
  the package is loaded.  This mechanism allows the user to set package
  ``load hooks'' in addition to startup code as provided by the package
  maintainers.

  \code{.Last.lib} is called when a package is detached.  Beware
  that it might be called if \code{.First.lib} has failed, so it
  should be written defensively. (It is called within \code{\link{try}},
  so errors will not stop the package being detached.)

  \code{.packages()} returns the ``base names'' of the currently attached
  packages \emph{invisibly} whereas
  \code{.packages(all.available = TRUE)} gives (visibly) \emph{all}
  packages available in the library location path \code{lib.loc}.

  \code{.path.package} returns the paths from which the named packages
  were loaded, or if none were named, for all currently loaded packages.
  Unless \code{quiet = TRUE} it will warn if some of the packages named
  are not loaded, and given an error if none are.

  \code{.find.package} returns the paths to the locations where the
  names packages can be found.  If \code{lib.loc} is not given or
  \code{use.attached} is \code{TRUE}, then attached packages are
  searched before the libraries.  If a package is found more than once,
  the first match is used.  Unless \code{quiet = TRUE} a warning will be
  given about the named packages which are not found, and an error if
  none are.  This function is not meant to be called by users, and its
  interface might change in future versions.

  \code{.Autoloaded} contains the ``base names'' of the packages for
  which autoloading has been promised.

  \code{.Library} is a character string giving the location of the
  default library, the ``library'' subdirectory of \code{R_HOME}.
  \code{.lib.loc} is a character vector with the locations of all
  library trees that \R should use.  It is initialized at startup from
  the environment variable \code{R_LIBS} (which should be a
#ifdef unix
  colon-separated
#endif
#ifdef windows
  semicolon-separated
#endif
  list of directories at which \R library trees are rooted) followed by
  \code{.Library}.
}
\value{
  \code{library} returns the list of loaded (or available) packages
  (or \code{TRUE} if \code{logical.return} is \code{TRUE}).
  \code{require} returns a logical indicating whether the required
  package is available.
