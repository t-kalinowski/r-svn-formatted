\title{Reload Saved Datasets}
\description{
  Reload datasets written with the function \code{save}.
}
\usage{
load(file, envir = parent.frame(), warnOldS4 = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{file}{a (readable binary) connection or a character string
    giving the name of the file to load.}
  \item{envir}{the environment where the data should be loaded.}
  \item{warnOldS4}{logical: should this attempt to detect pre-2.4.0 S4
    objects that need to be recreated?  Used by \code{\link{data}}.}
}
\details{
  \code{load} can load \R objects saved in the current or any earlier
  format.  It can read a compressed file (see \code{\link{save}})
  directly from a file or from a suitable connection (including a call
  to \code{\link{url}}).

  Only \R objects saved in the current format (used since \R 1.4.0)
  can be read from a connection.  If no input is available on a
  connection a warning will be given, but any input not in the current
  format will result in a error.
  
  Loading from an earlier version will give a warning about the
  \sQuote{magic number}: magic numbers \code{1971:1977} are from \R <
  0.99.0, and \code{R[ADX]1} from \R 0.99.0 to \R 1.3.1.
}
\value{
  A character vector of the names of objects created, invisibly.
}
\section{Warning}{
  Saved \R objects are binary files, even those saved with
  \code{ascii = TRUE}, so ensure that they are transferred without
  conversion of end of line markers.  \code{load} tries to detect this
  case and give an informative error message.
}
\note{
  Prior to  \R 2.4.0 an object saved as a \code{\link{pairlist}} was
  coerced to a \code{list}, silently (and undocumented).

\examples{
## save all data
xx <- pi # to ensure there is some data
save(list = ls(all=TRUE), file= "all.Rdata")
rm(xx)

## restore the saved values to the current environment
local({
   load("all.Rdata")
   ls()
})
## restore the saved values to the user's workspace
load("all.Rdata", .GlobalEnv)

unlink("all.Rdata")

\dontrun{
con <- url("http://some.where.net/R/data/example.rda")
## print the value to see what objects were created.
print(load(con))
close(con) # url() always opens the connection
