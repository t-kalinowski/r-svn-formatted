\usage{
mosaicplot(x, \dots)
mosaicplot.default (X, main = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL,
                    sort = NULL, off = NULL,
                    dir = NULL, color = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a contingency table, with optional category labels
    specified in the \code{dimnames(x)} attribute.  The table is
    best created by the \code{table()} command, which produces an
    object of type array.}
  \item{main}{character string for the mosaic title.}
  \item{xlab,ylab}{x- and y-axis labels; by default,
    \code{names(dimnames(X))}.}
  \item{sort}{vector ordering of the variables, containing a
    permutation of the integers \code{1:length(dim(x))} (the
    default).}
  \item{off}{vector of offsets to determine percentage spacing at each
    level of the mosaic (appropriate values are between 0 and 20,
    and the default is 10 at each level).  There should be one
    offset for each dimension of the contingency table.}
  \item{dir}{vector of split directions (\code{"v"} for vertical and
    \code{"h"} for horizontal) for each level of the mosaic, one
    direction for each dimension of the contingency table.  The
    default consists of alternating directions, beginning with a
    vertical split.}
  \item{color}{(\code{TRUE} or vector of integer colors) for color
    shading or (\code{FALSE}, the default) for empty boxes with no
    shading.}
