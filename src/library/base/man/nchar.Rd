\title{Count the Number of Characters (Bytes)}
\usage{
nchar(x, type = c("bytes", "chars", "width"))
}
\alias{nchar}
\description{
  \code{nchar} takes a character vector as an argument and
  returns a vector whose elements contain the sizes of
  the corresponding elements of \code{x}.
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{character vector, or a vector to be coerced to a character
    vector.}
  \item{type}{character string: partial matching is allowed.  See Details.}
}
\details{
  The \sQuote{size} of a character string can be measured in one of
  three ways.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{chars}}{The number of human-readable characters.}
    \item{\code{bytes}}{The number of bytes needed to store the string
      (plus in C a final terminator which is not counted).}
    \item{\code{width}}{The number of columns \code{cat} will use to
      print the string in a monospaced font.}
  }
  These will often be the same (but backspace \code{\b} and \code{\t}
  can affect the width).  There will be differences between the first
  two with multibyte character sequences, notably in UTF-8 locales, or
  if the byte stream contains embedded \code{nul} bytes.
  
  The internal equivalent of the default method of
  \code{\link{as.character}} is performed on \code{x}.  If you want to
  operate on non-vector objects passing them through
  \code{\link{deparse}} first will be required.
}
\value{
  An integer vector giving the size of each string,
  \code{2} for missing values (for \code{NA}).

  Not all platforms will return a non-missing value for \code{type="width"}.
}
\note{
  This does \strong{not} by default give the number of characters that
  will be used to \code{print()} the string, although it was documented
  to do so up to \R 2.0.1.  Use \code{\link{encodeString}} to find the
  characters used to print the string.

  As from \R 2.1.0 embedded \code{nul} bytes are included in the byte
  count (but not the final \code{nul}): previously the count stopped
  immediately before the first \code{nul}.
