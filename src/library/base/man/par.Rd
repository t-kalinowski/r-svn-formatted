\description{
  % \code{par} is an abomination before man and god.
  \code{par} can be used to set or query graphical parameters.
  Parameters can be set by specifying them as arguments to \code{par} in
  \code{tag = value} form, or by passing them as a list of tagged
  values.  In either case the previous values are returned in an
  invisible tagged list.  Such a list can be passed as an argument to
  \code{par} to restore the parameter values.

  Parameters are queried by giving vectors of character strings to
  \code{par}.  In this case, the values are returned in a tagged list.

\arguments{
  \item{adj}{The value of \code{adj} determines the way in which text
    strings are justified.  A value of \code{0} produces right
    left-justified text, \code{0.5} centered text and \code{1}
    right-justified text.}

    not annotate the plots they produce with axis and overall titles.
    The default is to do annotation.}
  \item{bg}{The color to be used for the background of plots.  A
    description of how colors are specified is given below.}
  \item{bty}{A character string which determined the type of box which
    is drawn about plots.  If \code{bty} is one of \code{"o"},
    \code{"l"}, \code{"7"} or \code{"c"} the resulting box resembles the
    corresponding upper case letter.  A value of \code{"n"} suppresses
    the box.}

    and symbols should be scaled relative to the default.}
  \item{cex.axis}{The magnification to be used for axis anotation
    relative to the current.}

    modifies the way that axes are annotated.
    The values of \code{x} and \code{y} give the (approximate) number of

    3=dotted 4=dotdashed) or as one of the character strings
    \code{"solid"}, \code{"dashed"}, \code{"dotted"} or
    \code{"dotdashed"}.
    Alternatively, a string of up to 8 characters may be given, giving
    the length (in points) of line segments which are alternatively

\section{Color Specification}{Colors can be specified in several
  different ways.  The simplest way is with a character string giving
  the color name (e.g., \code{"red"}).  A list of the possible colors
  can be obtained with the function \code{\link{colors}}.
  Alternatively, colors can be specified directly in terms of there RGB
  components with a string of the form \code{"#RRGGBB"} where each of
  the pairs \code{RR}, \code{GG}, \code{BB} consist of two hexidecimal
  digits giving a value in the range \code{00} to \code{FF}.  Colors can
  also be specified by giving an index into a small table of colors.
  This provides compatibility with S.

  The functions \code{rgb}, \code{hsv}, \code{gray} and \code{rainbow}
  provide additional ways of generating colors.}
\section{Line Type Specification}{Line types can either be specified by
  giving an index into a small built in table of line types (1=solid,
  2=dashed, 3=dotted) or directly as the lengths of on/off stretches of
  line.  This is done with a string of up to eight characters which give
  the lengths in consecutive positions in the string.  For example, the
  string \code{"33"} specifies three pixels on followed by three off and
  \code{"3313"} specifies three pixels on followed by three off followed
  by one on and finally three off.}
