\description{
  \code{pdf} starts the graphics device driver for producing PDF
  graphics.
}
\synopsis{
pdf(file = ifelse(onefile, "Rplots.pdf", "Rplot\%03d.pdf"),
    width = 6, height = 6, onefile = TRUE, \dots)
}
\usage{
pdf(file = ifelse(onefile, "Rplots.pdf", "Rplot\%03d.pdf"),
    width = 6, height = 6, onefile = TRUE, family = "Helvetica",
    encoding, bg, fg, pointsize)
}
\arguments{
  \item{file}{a character string giving the name of the file.}
  \item{width, height}{the width and height of the graphics region in
    inches.}
  \item{onefile}{logical: if \code{TRUE} (the default) allow multiple
    figures in one file.  If \code{FALSE}, generate a file name
    containing the page number.} 
  \item{family}{the font family to be used, one of \code{"AvantGarde"},
    \code{"Bookman"}, \code{"Courier"}, \code{"Helvetica"},
    \code{"Helvetica-Narrow"}, \code{"NewCenturySchoolbook"},
    \code{"Palatino"} or \code{"Times"}. }
  \item{encoding}{the name of an encoding file.  Defaults to
#ifdef unix
\code{"ISOLatin1.enc"}
#endif
#ifdef windows
\code{"WinAnsi.enc"}
#endif
#ifdef mac
\code{"MacRoman.enc"}
#endif
    in the \file{R\_HOME/afm} directory, which is used if the path does
    not contain a path separator.  An extension \code{".enc"} can be
    omitted.}
  \item{pointsize}{the default point size to be used.}
  \item{bg}{the default background color to be used.}
  \item{fg}{the default foreground color to be used.}
}
\details{
  \code{pdf()} opens the file \code{file} and the PDF commands needed to
  plot any graphics requested are sent to that file.

  See \code{\link{postscript}} for details of encodings, as the internal
  code is shared between the drivers.  The native PDF encoding is given
  in file \file{PDFDoc.enc}.

  \code{pdf} writes uncompressed PDF.  It is primarily intended for
  producing PDF graphics for inclusion in other documents, and
  PDF-includers such as \code{pdftex} are usually able to handle
  compression.

  At present the PDF is fairly simple, with each page being represented
  as a single stream.  The \R graphics model does not distinguish
  graphics objects at the level of the driver interface.

  There is an internal limit of 500 pages per PDF file, which should
  be ample.

\note{
  Acrobat Reader does not use the fonts specified but rather emulates
  them from multiple-master fonts.  This can be seen in imprecise
  centring of characters, for example the multiply and divide signs in
  Helvetica.
