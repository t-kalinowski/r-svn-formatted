\title{Running Time of R}
\usage{
proc.time()
}
\alias{proc.time}
\description{
  \code{proc.time} determines how much time (in seconds) the currently
  running R process already consumed.
}
\value{
  A numeric vector of length 5, containing the user, system, and total
  elapsed times for the currently running R process, and the cumulative
  sum of user and system times of any child processes spawned by it.

  It is most useful for ``timing'' the evaluation of R expressions,
  which can be done conveniently with \code{\link{system.time}}.
}
\seealso{
  \code{\link{system.time}} for timing a valid R expression
}
\examples{
time <- proc.time()
for (i in 1:50) mad(runif(500))
proc.time() - time
}
