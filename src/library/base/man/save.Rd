\arguments{
  \item{\dots}{the names of the objects to be saved.}
  \item{list}{A character vector containing the names of objects to be
    saved.}
  \item{file}{the name of the file where the data will be saved.}
  \item{ascii}{if \code{TRUE}, an ASCII representation of the data is
    written.  This is useful for transporting data between machines of
    different types.  The default value of \code{ascii} is \code{FALSE}
    which leads to a more compact binary file being written.}
}
\description{
  \code{save} writes a external representation of \R objects to the
  specified file.  The objects can be read back from the file at a later
  date by using the function \code{load}.

  \code{save.image()} is just a short-cut for ``save my current work'',
  i.e., \code{save(list = ls(), file = ".RData")}. It is what also
  happens with \code{\link{q}("yes")}/
