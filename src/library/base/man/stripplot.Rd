\usage{
stripplot(x, method="overplot", jitter=0.1, offset=1/3,
        vertical=FALSE, group.names)
}
\alias{stripplot}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the data from which the plots are to be produced.
The data can be specified as a single vector, or as
list of vectors, each corresponding to a component plot.
Alternatively a symbolic specification of the form
\code{x ~ g} can be given, indicating the the observations
in the vector \code{x} are to be grouped according to
the levels of the factor \code{g}.
\code{NA}s are allowed in the data.}
\item{method}{the method to be used to separate coincident points.
The default method \code{"overplot"} causes such points to be overplotted,
but it is also possible to specify \code{"jitter"} to jitter the
points, or \code{"stack"} have coincident points stacked.
The last method only makes sense for very granular data.}
\item{jitter}{when jittering is used, \code{jitter} gives the
amount of jittering applied.}
\item{offset}{when stacking is used, points are stacked this many
line-heights (symbol widths) apart.}
\item{vertical}{when vertical is \code{TRUE} the plots are
drawn vertically rather than the default horizontal.}
\item{group.names}{group labels which will be printed alongside
(or underneath) each plot.}

Graphical parameters can also be specified as arguments.
}
\description{
\code{stripplot} produces one dimensional scatter plots (or dot plots)
of the given data.  These plots are are good alternative to boxplots
when sample sizes are small.

Extensive examples of the use of this kind of plot can be found in
Box, Hunter and Hunter or Seber and Wild.
