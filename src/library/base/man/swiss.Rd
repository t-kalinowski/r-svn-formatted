\description{
  Standardized fertility measure and socio-economic indicators for each
  of 47 French-speaking provinces of Switzerland at about 1888.

}
\format{A data frame with 47 observations on 6 variables, \emph{each} of
  which is in percent, i.e., in \eqn{[0,100]}.

  \tabular{rll}{
    [,1] \tab Fertility \tab \eqn{I_g}{Ig}, ``common standardized
    fertility measure''\cr
    [,2] \tab Agriculture\tab \% involved in agriculture as occupation\cr
    [,3] \tab Examination\tab \% ``draftees'' receiving highest mark
    on army examination\cr
    [,4] \tab Education \tab \% education beyond primary school.\cr
    [,5] \tab Catholic \tab \% catholic (as opposed to ``protestant'').\cr
    [,6] \tab Infant.Mortality\tab live births who live less than 1
    year.

  All variables but `Fertility' give proportions of the population.

\details{
  (paraphrasing Mosteller and Tukey):

  Switzerland, in 1888, was entering a period known as the ``demographic
  transition''; i.e., its fertility was beginning to fall from the high
  level typical of underdeveloped countries.

  The data collected are for 47 seven French-speaking ``provinces'' at
  about 1888.

  Here, all variables are scaled to \eqn{[0,100]}, where in the
  original, all but \code{"Catholic"} were scaled to \eqn{[0,1]}.
