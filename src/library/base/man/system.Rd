\description{
\code{system} invokes the system command specified by \code{command}.
If \code{intern} is \code{TRUE} then popen is used to invoke the
command and the output collected, line by line, into an R string
vector which is returned as the value of \code{system}.  If \code{intern}
is \code{FALSE} then the C function \code{system} is used to invoke
the command and the value returned by \code{system} is the exit
status of this function.  This function provides users with
the ability to invoke system commands on whatever platform they
are using.
