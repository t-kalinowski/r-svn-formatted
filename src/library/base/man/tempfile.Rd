\title{Create Names for Temporary Files}
\description{
  \code{tempfile} returns a vector of character strings which can be used as
  names for temporary files.
}
\usage{
tempfile(pattern = "file", tmpdir = tempdir())
tempdir()
}
\arguments{
  \item{pattern}{a non-empty character vector giving the initial part
    of the name.}
  \item{tmpdir}{a non-empty character vector giving the directory name}
}
\value{
  For \code{tempfile} a character vector giving the names of possible
  (temporary) files. Note that no files are generated by
  \code{tempfile}.

  For \code{tempdir}, the path of the per-session temporary directory.
#ifdef windows

  Both will use backslash as the path separator.
#endif
}
\details{
  If \code{pattern} has length greater than one then the result is of the
  same length giving a temporary file name for each component of
  \code{pattern}.

  The names are very likely to be unique among calls to \code{tempfile}
  in an \R session and across simultaneous \R sessions.  The filenames are
  guaranteed not to be currently in use.

#ifdef unix
  The file name is made of the pattern, the process number in hex and a
  random suffix in hex.  By default, the filenames will be in the
  directory given by \code{tempdir()}.  This will be a subdirectory of
  the directory given by the environment variable \env{TMPDIR} if set,
  otherwise \code{"/tmp"}.
#endif
#ifdef windows
  \code{tempdir()} gives a subdirectory of the first found
  of the environment variables \env{TMP}, \env{TEMP} and \env{R\_USER}
  (see \code{\link{Rconsole}}) which points to a writeable directory.
  If the path to the directory contains a space in any of the
  components, the path returned will use the shortnames version of the
  path.
