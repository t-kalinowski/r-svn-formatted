window(x, start, end, frequency, deltat)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{a time-series or other object.}
\item{start}{the start time of the period of interest.}
\item{end}{the end time of the period of interest.}
\item{frequency}{the new sampling frequency, which should be a sub-multiple
    of the original frequency.}
\item{deltat}{the new time interval between observations, which should
    be a multiple of the original frequency.}
}
\description{
    \code{window} is a generic function which
    extracts the subset of the object \code{x}
    observed between the times \code{start} and \code{end}.
}
\details{
    The default method applies to objects with a \code{\link{tsp}}
    attribute, or vectors or matrices (which are assumed to have
    been observed at times \code{1} to \code{NROW(x)}).
}
\value{
    An object with a \code{tsp} attribute, and with class that of the
    \code{x} unless (as for time series) that class is changed by
    subsetting. The \code{ts} ensures the result has class \code{"ts"}.
