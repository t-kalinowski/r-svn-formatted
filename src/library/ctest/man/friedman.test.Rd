\title{Friedman Rank Sum Test}
\description{
  Performs a Friedman rank sum test with unreplicated blocked data.
}
\usage{
friedman.test(y, groups, blocks)
}
\arguments{
  \item{y}{either a numeric vector of data values, or a data matrix.}
  \item{groups}{a vector giving the group for the corresponding
    elements of \code{y} if this is a vector;  ignored if \code{y}
    is a matrix.  If not a factor object, it is coerced to one.}
  \item{blocks}{a vector giving the block for the corresponding
    elements of \code{y} if this is a vector;  ignored if \code{y}
    is a matrix.  If not a factor object, it is coerced to one.}
}
\details{
  \code{friedman.test} can be used for analyzing unreplicated complete
  block designs (i.e., there is exactly one observation in \code{y}
  for each combination of levels of \code{groups} and \code{blocks})
  where the normality assumption may be violated.

  The null hypothesis is that apart from an effect of \code{blocks},
  the location parameter of \code{y} is the same in each of the
  \code{groups}. 

  If \code{y} is a matrix, \code{groups} and \code{blocks} are
  obtained from the column and row indices, respectively.  \code{NA}'s
  are not allowed in \code{groups} or \code{blocks};  if \code{y}
  contains \code{NA}'s, corresponding blocks are removed.
}
\value{
  A list with class \code{"htest"} containing the following components:
  \item{statistic}{the value of Friedman's chi-squared statistic.}
  \item{parameter}{the degrees of freedom of the approximate
    chi-square distribution of the test statistic.}
  \item{p.value}{the p-value of the test.}
  \item{method}{the string \code{"Friedman rank sum test"}.}
  \item{data.name}{a character string giving the names of the data.}

## Hollander & Wolfe (1973), p. 140ff.
## Comparison of three methods (``round out'', ``narrow angle'', and
##  ``wide angle'') for rounding first base.  For each of 18 players
##  and the three method, the average time of two runs from a point on
##  the first base line 35ft from home plate to a point 15ft short of
##  second base is recorded.
