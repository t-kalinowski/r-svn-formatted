/* Was
    double precision function prho(n, is, ifault)

 Changed to subroutine by KH to allow for .Fortran interfacing.
 Also, change `prho' argument in the code to `pv'.
 And, fix a bug.

 From R ver. 1.1.x [March, 2000] by MM:
 - Translate Fortran to C
 - use pnorm() instead of less precise alnorm().
 - new argument lower_tail --> potentially increased precision in extreme cases.
