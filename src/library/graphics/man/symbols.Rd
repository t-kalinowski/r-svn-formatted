\title{Draw Symbols (Circles, Squares, Stars, Thermometers, Boxplots) on a Plot}
\description{
  This function draws symbols on a plot.  One of six symbols;
  \emph{circles}, \emph{squares}, \emph{rectangles}, \emph{stars},
  \emph{thermometers}, and \emph{boxplots}, can be plotted at a
  specified set of x and y coordinates.  Specific aspects of the
  symbols, such as relative size, can be customized by additional
  parameters.
}
\usage{
symbols(x, y = NULL, circles, squares, rectangles, stars,
        thermometers, boxplots, inches = TRUE, add = FALSE,
        fg = 1, bg = NA, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, main = NULL,
        xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x, y}{the x and y co-ordinates for the symbols. They can be
    specified in any way which is accepted by \code{\link{xy.coords}}.}
  \item{circles}{a vector giving the radii of the circles.}
  \item{squares}{a vector giving the length of the sides of the squares.}
  \item{rectangles}{a matrix with two columns.  The first column gives
    widths and the second the heights of rectangle symbols.}
  \item{stars}{a matrix with three or more columns giving the lengths
    of the rays from the center of the stars.  \code{NA} values
    are replaced by zeroes.}
  \item{thermometers}{a matrix with three or four columns.  The first
    two columns give the width and height of the thermometer symbols.
    If there are three columns, the third is taken as a proportion.
    The thermometers are filled from their base to this proportion
    of their height.  If there are four columns, the third and fourth
    columns are taken as proportions.  The thermometers are filled
    between these two proportions of their heights.}
  \item{boxplots}{a matrix with five columns.  The first two columns
    give the width and height of the boxes, the next two columns
    give the lengths of the lower and upper whiskers and the fifth
    the proportion (with a warning if not in [0,1]) of the way up
    the box that the median line is drawn.}
  \item{inches}{If \code{inches} is \code{FALSE}, the units are taken
    to be those of the x axis.  If \code{inches} is \code{TRUE},
    the symbols are scaled so that the largest symbol is one
    inch in height.  If a number is given the symbols are scaled to
    make largest symbol this height in inches.}
  \item{add}{if \code{add} is \code{TRUE}, the symbols are added to
    an existing plot, otherwise a new plot is created.}
  \item{fg}{colors the symbols are to be drawn in (the default is
    the value of the \code{col} graphics parameter).}
  \item{bg}{if specified, the symbols are filled with this color.
    The default is to leave the symbols unfilled. }
  \item{xlab}{the x label of the plot if \code{add} is not true; this
    applies to the following arguments as well.  Defaults to the
    \code{\link{deparse}}d expression used for \code{x}.}
  \item{ylab}{the y label of the plot.}
  \item{main}{a main title for the plot.}
  \item{xlim}{numeric of length 2 giving the x limits for the plot.}
  \item{ylim}{numeric of length 2 giving the y limits for the plot.}
  \item{\dots}{graphics parameters can also be passed to this function,
    as can the plot aspect ratio \code{asp} (see \code{\link{plot.window}}).}
}
\details{
  Observations which have missing coordinates or missing size
  parameters are not plotted.  The exception to this is \emph{stars}.
  In that case, the length of any rays which are \code{NA} is reset
  to zero.

  Circles of radius zero are plotted at radius one pixel (which is
  device-dependent).
#ifdef windows
  On \code{\link{windows}} devices circles are plotted
  at radius at least one pixel as some Windows versions omit smaller
  circles.

x <- 1:10
y <- sort(10*runif(10))
z <- runif(10)

## Note that  example(trees)  shows more sensible plots!
N <- nrow(trees)
attach(trees)
## Girth is diameter in inches
symbols(Height, Volume, circles=Girth/24, inches=FALSE,
        main="Trees' Girth")# xlab and ylab automatically
## Colors too:
palette(rainbow(N, end = 0.9))
symbols(Height, Volume, circles=Girth/16, inches=FALSE, bg = 1:N,
        fg="gray30", main="symbols(*, circles=Girth/16, bg = 1:N)")
palette("default"); detach()
