\title{Draw a Grid Graphical Object}
\description{
  Produces graphical output from a graphical object.
}
\usage{
grid.draw(x, recording=TRUE)
}
%- maybe also `usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{An object of class \code{"grob"} or NULL.}
  \item{recording}{A logical value to indicate whether the drawing
    operation should be recorded on the Grid display list.}
}
\details{
  This function doesn't do much itself beyond some system bookkeeping.

  It calls the generic function \code{draw.details}, dispatching on the
  class of the \code{list.struct} within the graphical object, and
  the actual drawing occurs in the appropriate method.
}
\value{
  None.
