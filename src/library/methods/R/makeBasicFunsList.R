    ## useful since all these functions may operate in a similar
    ## manner (by analogy, e.g., with the Math group).

.InitSubsetMethods <- function(where)
{
    ## create some methods for the functions in .BasicFunsList.

    ## The strategy on initialization is to create the methods list
    ## objects by setMethod calls, and then move them to the
    ## .BasicFunsMethods list, from which they will be retrieved when
    ## the generic is installed; see getGeneric.

    ## The mlist objects can not be left in the methods library itself
    ## after initialization, since the basic functions are not "turned
    ## on" as generics until some other package or user defines
    ## methods for them.

    ## This facility is not currently instantiated, though there are
    ## some desirable changes to the "[" and related functions, to
    ## untangle the current messing with "drop" and multiple
    ## subscripts, in the vector case.
