The RSMethods package contains class and methods software implementing
the formal model described in "Programming with Data"

The package can be installed in the usual way:

  R INSTALL RSMethods

If you have version 1.3.0 or later of R, the installation in this way
will create a saved image at install time.  Look for the message

  Initializing class and method definitions now

during the INSTALL.  If you don't see this, you are running an earlier
version of R (or at least of the INSTALL script)--not a good idea, and
not guaranteed to work with RSMethods.
