\usage{
class(object)

class(object) <- value
}
\description{

Returns the name of the object's class as a character string.

In contrast to the version of this function in the base package, this
version of \code{class} never
returns \code{NULL}.  For objects that do not have a formal class
definition, and do not have the \code{"class"} attribute set, the
value returned is effectively the same as \code{data.class}.

The replacement version of the function sets the class to the value
provided.  For classes that have a formal definition, directly
replacing the class this way is strongly deprecated.  The expression
\code{as(object, value)} is the way to coerce an object to a
particular class.
