\title{Implementation of Pierre L'Ecuyer's RngStreams}
\description{
  This is an \R re-implementation of Pierre L'Ecuyer's \sQuote{RngStreams}
  multiple streams of (pseudo-)random numbers.
}
\usage{
nextRNGStream(seed)
nextRNGSubStream(seed)
}
\arguments{
  \item{seed}{An integer vector of length 7: see \code{\link{RNG}} for
    the valid values.}
}
\details{
  The \sQuote{RngStream} interface works with (potentially) multiple
  streams of pseudo-random numbers: this is particularly suitable for
  working with parallel computations since each task can be assigned a
  separate RNG stream.

  This uses as its underlying generator \code{RNGkind("L'Ecuyer-CMRG")},
  of L'Ecuyer (1999) which has a seed vector of 6 (signed) integers and a
  period of around \eqn{2^{191}}{2^191}.  Each \sQuote{stream} is a
  subsequence of the period of length \eqn{2^{127}}{2^127} which is in
  turn divided into \sQuote{substreams} of length \eqn{2^{76}}{2^76}.
}
\value{
  A value which can be assigned to \code{.Random.seed}.
