\title{Distribution of the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Statistic}
\description{
  Density, distribution function, quantile function and random
  generation for the distribution of the Wilcoxon Signed Rank statistic
  obtained from a sample with size \code{n}.
}
\usage{
dsignrank(x, n, log = FALSE)
psignrank(q, n, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
qsignrank(p, n, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
rsignrank(nn, n)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x,q}{vector of quantiles.}
  \item{p}{vector of probabilities.}
  \item{nn}{number of observations. If \code{length(nn) > 1}, the length
    is taken to be the number required.}
  \item{n}{number(s) of observations in the sample(s).  A positive
    integer, or a vector of such integers.}
  \item{log, log.p}{logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p).}
  \item{lower.tail}{logical; if TRUE (default), probabilities are
    \eqn{P[X \le x]}{P[X <= x]}, otherwise, \eqn{P[X > x]}{P[X > x]}.}
}
\value{
  \code{dsignrank} gives the density,
  \code{psignrank} gives the distribution function,
  \code{qsignrank} gives the quantile function, and
  \code{rsignrank} generates random deviates.
}
\details{
  This distribution is obtained as follows.  Let \code{x} be a sample of
  size \code{n} from a continuous distribution symmetric about the
  origin.  Then the Wilcoxon signed rank statistic is the sum of the
  ranks of the absolute values \code{x[i]} for which \code{x[i]} is
  positive.  This statistic takes values between \eqn{0} and
  \eqn{n(n+1)/2}, and its mean and variance are \eqn{n(n+1)/4} and
  \eqn{n(n+1)(2n+1)/24}, respectively.

  If either of the first two arguments is a vector, the recycling rule is
  used to do the calculations for all combinations of the two up to
  the length of the longer vector.
