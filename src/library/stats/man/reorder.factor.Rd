\title{Reorder Levels of a Factor}
\description{
  \code{reorder} is a generic function.  Its \code{"factor"} method
  reorders the levels of a factor depending on values of a second
  variable, usually numeric.
}

\usage{
reorder(x, \dots)

\method{reorder}{factor}(x, X, FUN = mean, \dots,
        order = is.ordered(x))
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    a factor (possibly ordered) whose levels will be reordered.
  }
  \item{X}{ a vector of the same length as \code{x}, whose subset
    of values for each unique level of \code{x} determines the
    eventual order of that level.
  }
  \item{FUN}{ a function whose first argument is a vector and
    returns a scalar, to be applied to each subset of \code{X}
    determined by the levels of \code{x}.
  }
  \item{\dots}{ optional: extra arguments supplied to \code{FUN}}
  \item{order}{ logical, whether return value will be an ordered factor
    rather than a factor.
  }
}

\value{
  A factor or an ordered factor (depending on the value of
  \code{order}), with the order of the levels determined by
  \code{FUN} applied to \code{X} grouped by \code{x}.  The
  levels are ordered such that the values returned by \code{FUN}
  are in increasing order.

  Additionally, the values of \code{FUN} applied to the subsets of
  \code{X} (in the original order of the levels of \code{x}) is returned
  as the \code{"scores"} attribute.
