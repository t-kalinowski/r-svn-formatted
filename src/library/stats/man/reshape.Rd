\description{
  This function reshapes a data frame between \sQuote{wide} format with
  repeated measurements in separate columns of the same record and
  \sQuote{long} format with the repeated measurements in separate
  records.
}
\usage{
reshape(data, varying = NULL, v.names = NULL, timevar = "time",
	idvar = "id", ids = 1:NROW(data),
	times = seq(length = length(varying[[1]])),
	drop = NULL, direction, new.row.names = NULL,
	split = list(regexp="\\.", include=FALSE))
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{a data frame}
  \item{varying}{names of sets of variables in the wide format that
    correspond to single variables in long format
    (\sQuote{time-varying}).  A list of vectors (or optionally a matrix
    for \code{direction="wide"}).  See below for more details and
    options.}
  \item{v.names}{names of variables in the long format that correspond
    to multiple variables in the wide format.}
  \item{timevar}{the variable in long format that differentiates multiple
    records from the same group or individual.}
  \item{idvar}{Names of one or more variables in long format that identify multiple
    records from the same group/individual.  These variables may also be
    present in wide format}
  \item{ids}{the values to use for a newly created \code{idvar}
    variable in long format.}
  \item{times}{the values to use for a newly created \code{timevar}
    variable in long format.}
  \item{drop}{a vector of names of variables to drop before reshaping}
  \item{direction}{character string, either \code{"wide"} to reshape to
    wide format, or \code{"long"} to reshape to long format.}
  \item{new.row.names}{logical; if \code{TRUE} and \code{direction="wide"},
    create new row names in long format from the values of the id and
    time variables.}
  \item{split}{information for guessing the \code{varying},
    \code{v.names}, and \code{times} arguments.  See below for details.}
}
\details{
  The arguments to this function are described in terms of longitudinal
  data, as that is the application motivating the functions.  A \sQuote{wide}
  longitudinal dataset will have one record for each individual with
  some time-constant variables that occupy single columns and some
  time-varying variables that occupy a column for each time point.  In
  \sQuote{long} format there will be multiple records for each individual, with
  some variables being constant across these records and others varying
  across the records.  A \sQuote{long} format dataset also needs a \sQuote{time}
  variable identifying which time point each record comes from and an
  \sQuote{id} variable showing which records refer to the same person.

  If the data frame resulted from a previous \code{reshape} then the
  operation can be reversed simply by \code{reshape(a)}. The
  \code{direction} argument is optional and the other arguments are
  stored as attributes on the data frame.

  If \code{direction="long"} and no \code{varying} or \code{v.names}
  arguments are supplied it is assumed that all variables except
  \code{idvar} and \code{timevar} are time-varying. They are all
  expanded into multiple variables in wide format.

  If \code{direction="wide"} the \code{varying} argument can be a vector
  of column names or column numbers (converted to column names). The
  function will attempt to guess the \code{v.names} and \code{times} from
  these names.  The default is variable names like \code{x.1},
  \code{x.2},where \code{split=list(regexp="\\.",include=FALSE)} to
  specifies to split at the dot and drop it from the name. To have alphabetic
  followed by numeric times use
  \code{split=list(regexp="[A-Za-z][0-9]",include=TRUE)}. This splits
  between the alphabetic and numeric parts of the name and does not drop
  the regular expression.

\examples{
summary(Indometh)
wide <- reshape(Indometh, v.names="conc", idvar="Subject",
                timevar="time", direction="wide")
wide

reshape(wide, direction="long")
reshape(wide, idvar="Subject", varying=list(names(wide)[2:12]),
        v.names="conc", direction="long")

## times need not be numeric
df <- data.frame(id=rep(1:4,rep(2,4)), visit=I(rep(c("Before","After"),4)),
              x=rnorm(4), y=runif(4))
df
reshape(df, timevar="visit", idvar="id", direction="wide")
## warns that y is really varying
reshape(df, timevar="visit", idvar="id", direction="wide", v.names="x")


##  unbalanced 'long' data leads to NA fill in 'wide' form
df2 <- df[1:7,]
df2
reshape(df2, timevar="visit", idvar="id", direction="wide")

## Alternative regular expressions for guessing names
df3 <- data.frame(id=1:4, age=c(40,50,60,50), dose1=c(1,2,1,2),
                  dose2=c(2,1,2,1), dose4=c(3,3,3,3))
reshape(df3, direction="long", varying=3:5,
        split=list(regexp="[a-z][0-9]", include=TRUE))


## an example that isn't longitudinal data
state.x77 <- as.data.frame(state.x77)
long <- reshape(state.x77, idvar="state", ids=row.names(state.x77),
                times=names(state.x77), timevar="Characteristic",
                varying=list(names(state.x77)), direction="long")

reshape(long, direction="wide")

reshape(long, direction="wide", new.row.names=unique(long$state))

## multiple id variables
df3 <- data.frame(school=rep(1:3,each=4), class=rep(9:10,6), time=rep(c(1,1,2,2),3),
score=rnorm(12))
wide <- reshape(df3, idvar=c("school","class"), direction="wide")
wide
## transform back
reshape(wide)
