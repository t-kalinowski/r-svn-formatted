\note{\code{tkStartGUI()} saves its evaluation environment as
  \code{.GUIenv}. This means that the user interface elements can be
  accessed in order to extend the interface. The three main objects are
  named \code{Term}, \code{Menu}, and \code{Toolbar}, and the various
  submenus and callback functions can be seen with
  \code{ls(envir=.GUIenv)}. }
