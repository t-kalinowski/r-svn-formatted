Preliminary time-series package for R 0.65
==========================================

This is a preliminary version of a time-series package; at present
the functionality is somewhat limited in that not all the options are
yet implemented or may be very slow.

Functions in base R:
-------------------

ts		Create a (univariate or multivariate) ts object
[.ts		Subsetting method for ts objects.
as.ts, is.ts	Coercion and membership functions
plot, print	Methods for plot and print

aggregate	Computes summaries (e.g. sum) over disjoint time intervals
diff		Lagged differences of a time series
end		Time of last observation
frequency	Number of observations per unit of time
start		Time of first observation
time		Create time series giving the times of observations
tsp, tsp<-	Get and set time-series attributes
window		Subset to a time window


Functions in package ts:
-----------------------

acf		Autocovariance and autocorrelation function
ar              Wrapper for autoregression estimation functions
ar.yw           Estimate autoregression model by solving Yule-Walker equations
cpgram		Plot cumulative periodogram of univariate time series
cycle		Create time series giving the positions in a cycle 
		of a time series
deltat		Return time interval between observations
embed           Embedding a time series
filter		Linear filtering on a time series
lag		Compute lagged version of time series
na.omit.ts	na.omit method for time series
pacf		Partial autocorrelation function
plot.acf        Plot autocorrelation function
plot.spec       Plot spectral density estimate
spec.ar	        Estimate spectral density by autoregression
spec.pgram      Estimate spectral density from periodogram
spec.taper      Taper by cosine bell
spectrum        Wrapper for spectral density estimation functions
stl		Seasonal decomposition using loess
ts.intersect	Bind time series as multivariate ts over the common time base
ts.union	Bind time series as multivariate ts over their total time base

TO DO

ar.burg		maybe
arima.forecast
arima.mle
