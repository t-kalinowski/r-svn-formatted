=========================

Functions in base R:
-------------------

ts		Create a (univariate or multivariate) ts object
[.ts		Subsetting method for ts objects.
as.ts, is.ts	Coercion and membership functions
plot, lines,  print	methods

cbind.ts	cbind method for time series (aligns time bases)
na.omit.ts	na.omit method for time series: omits at ends only
Ops.ts		arithmetic (such as + - * /) for time series

aggregate	Computes summaries (e.g. sum) over disjoint time intervals
diff		Lagged differences of a time series
end		Time of last observation
frequency	Number of observations per unit of time
deltat		Return time interval between observations
time		Create time series giving the times of observations
cycle		Create time series giving the positions in a cycle 
		   of a time series
start		Time of first observation
tsp, tsp<-	Get and set time-series attributes
window		Subset to a time window
