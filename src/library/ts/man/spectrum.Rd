\arguments{
    \item{x}{A univariate or multivariate time series.}

    \item{method}{String specifying the method used to estimate the spectral 
	density. Allowed methods are "pgram" (the default) and "ar".}

    \item{plot}{logical. If \code{TRUE} then the spectral density is plotted.}

    \item{\dots}{Further arguments to specific spec methods or
	\code{plot.spec}.}

    \item{spec.obj}{An object of class \code{spec}.}

    \item{add}{logical. If \code{TRUE} then lines are added to the
	existing plot.}

    \item{ci}{Coverage probability for confidence interval. Plotting of the
	confidence bar is omitted unless \code{ci} is strictly positive.}

    \item{log}{If \code{"dB"}, plot on log10 (decibel) scale (as S-PLUS),
	otherwise use conventional log scale or linear scale. Logical values
	are also accepted.  The default is \code{"yes"} unless
	\code{options(ts.S.compat = TRUE)} has been set, when it is
	\code{"dB"}.}

    \item{ci.col, ci.lty}{Colour for plotting confidence bar, colour and
	line type for confidence intervals for coherency and phase.}

\description{
    The \code{spectrum} function estimates the spectral density of a
    time series. This is a wrapper function which calls the methods
    \code{\link{spec.pgram}} and \code{\link{spec.ar}}.

    The generic function \code{plot} has a method for \code{spec} objects:
    for multivariate time series it plots the marginal spectra of the
    series or pairs plots of the coherency and phase of the cross-spectra.
}
\value{
    An object of class \code{spec}, which is a list containing at
    least the following elements:
    \item{freq}{vector of frequencies at which the spectral
	density is estimated. (Possibly approximate Fourier frequencies.)}

    \item{spec}{Vector (for univariate series) or matrix (for multivariate
	series) of estimates of the spectral density at frequencies
	corresponding to \code{freq}.}

    \item{coh}{\code{NULL} for univariate series. For multivariate time
	series, a matrix containing the squared coherency between different
	series. Column \eqn{ i + (j - 1) * (j - 2)/2} of \code{coh}
	contains the squared coherency between columns \eqn{i} and \eqn{j}
	of \code{x}, where \eqn{i > j}.}

    \item{phase}{\code{NULL} for univariate series. For multivariate
	time series a matrix containing the cross-spectrum phase between
	different series. The format is the same as \code{coh}.}

    \item{series}{The name of the time series.}

    \item{snames}{For multivariate input, the names of the component series.}

    \item{method}{The method used to calculate the spectrum.}

    The result is returned invisibly if \code{plot} is true.
}
\details{
    The spectrum here is defined with scaling \code{1/frequency(x)},
    following S-PLUS. This makes the spectral density a density over the
    range \code{(-frequency(x)/2, +frequency(x)/2]}, whereas a more
    common scaling is \eqn{2*\pi} and range (-0.5, 0.5]
    (e.g. Bloomfield) or 1 and range \eqn{(-\pi, \pi]}.

    If available, a confidence interval will be plotted by
    \code{plot.spec}: this is asymmetric, and the width of the centre
    mark indicates the equivalent bandwidth.
}
\note{
    The default plot for \code{spec} objects is quite complex, including an
    error bar and default title, subtitle and axis labels. The defaults can
    all be overridden by supplying the appropriate graphical parameters.
