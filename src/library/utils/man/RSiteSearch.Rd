  This function is designed to work with the search site at
  \url{http://search.r-project.org}, and depends on that site
  continuing to be made available (thanks to Jonathan Baron and the
  School of Arts and Sciences of the University of Pennslyvania).

  Unique partial matches will work for all arguments.  Each new
  browser window will stay open unless you close it.
