\title{Retrieve an R Object, Including from a Namespace}
\description{
  This functions locates all objects with name matching its argument,
  whether visible on the search path, registered as an S3 method or in a
  namespace but not exported.
}
\usage{
getAnywhere(x)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a character string or name.}
}
\details{
  The function looks at all loaded namespaces, whether or not they are
  associated with a package on the search list.

  Where functions are found as an S3 method, an attempt is made to find
  which namespace registered them.  This may not be correct, especially
  if a namespace is unloaded.
}
\value{
  An object of class \code{"getAnywhere"}.  This is a list with components
  \item{name}{the name searched for.}
  \item{objs}{a list of objects found}
  \item{where}{a character vector explaining where the object(s) were found}
  \item{visible}{logical: is the object visible}
  \item{dups}{logical: is the object identical to one earlier in the
    list.}

  Normally the structure will be hidden by the \code{print} method.
  There is a \code{[} method to extract one or more of the objects found.
