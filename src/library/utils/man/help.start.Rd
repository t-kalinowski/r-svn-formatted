\title{Hypertext Documentation}
\alias{help.start}
\description{
  Start the hypertext (currently HTML) version of \R's online
  documentation.
}
\usage{
#ifdef unix  
help.start(gui = "irrelevant", browser = getOption("browser"),
           remote = NULL, searchEngine = FALSE)
#endif
#ifdef windows  
help.start(update = TRUE, gui = "irrelevant",
           browser = getOption("browser"), searchEngine = FALSE)
#endif
}
\arguments{
  \item{gui}{just for compatibility with S-PLUS.}
  \item{browser}{the name of the program to be used as hypertext
    browser. It should be in the \env{PATH}, or a full path specified.
    Alternatively, it can be a function which will be called with an
    URL as its only argument.
  }
#ifdef unix  
  \item{remote}{A character giving a valid URL for the
    \file{\var{\link[base:Rhome]{R_HOME}}} directory on a remote location.}
#endif
#ifdef windows  
  \item{update}{logical: should this attempt to update the indices to
    reflect the currently installed packages.}
#endif
  \item{searchEngine}{logical: if true go directly to the search engine
    page.  A workaround for some Firefox 3 versions (see \sQuote{Notes}).}
}
\details{
#ifdef unix
  All the packages in the known library trees are linked to directory
  \file{.R} in the per-session temporary directory.  The links are
  re-made each time \code{\link{make.packages.html}} or \code{help.start}
  is run, which should be done after packages are installed, updated or
  removed.

  A side effect is to set \code{options(htmlhelp = TRUE)} so that future
  help requests (by default) are sent to the browser.

  If the browser named by the \code{browser} argument is different from
  the default browser as specified by \code{options("browser")}, the
  default is changed to the given browser so that it gets used for all
  future help requests.  (This only holds when \code{browser} is a name,
  not a function.)
#endif
#ifdef windows
  The Windows file association mechanism is used to send the HTML file
  to a browser, launching one if necessary.

  Unlike Unix systems, running \code{help.start} does not send all
  future help requests to the browser: use \code{options(htmlhelp=TRUE)}
  to set that.

  Alternatively, a specific browser can be started if \code{browser} is
  specified, but \code{help} will still use the file association mechanism.

  \code{help.start} and the Java-based search engine have been tested
  under Internet Explorer 6/7,  Opera 7.54,
  Mozilla 1.7 and Firefox 1.5/2.0/3.0.  Users of IE
  will probably need to allow \sQuote{active content} from the
  \sQuote{information bar} before the search engine can be used.
#endif
}
\note{
  There is a Java-based search facility available from the HTML page
  that \code{help.start} brings up.  Should this not work, please
  consult the \sQuote{R Installation and Administration} manual which is
  linked from that page.

  Note to users of Firefox 3.0 to 3.0.6: the search results have links
  that are resolved incorrectly by that browser if starting from the
  normal HTML index page.  The workaround is to start with
  \code{help.start(searchEngine = TRUE)}.  This was fixed in Firefox 3.0.7.
