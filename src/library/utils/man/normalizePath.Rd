\title{Express File Paths in Canonical Form}
\description{
  Convert file paths to canonical form for the platform, to display them
  in a user-understandable form.
}
\usage{
normalizePath(path)
}
\arguments{
  \item{path}{character vector of file paths.}
}
\details{
#ifdef unix
  Where the platform supports it this turns paths into absolute paths
  in their canonical form (no \code{./}, \code{../} nor symbolic links).
#endif
#ifdef windows
  This converts relative paths to absolute paths, and converts short
  names to long names.  It will always use backlashes as the path separator.
#endif

  If the path is not a real path the result is undefined but will most
  likely be the corresponding input element.
}
\value{
  A character vector.
}
\examples{
cat(normalizePath(c(R.home(), tempdir())), sep = "\n")
