#  Enviroment File for R
#  ==========================

#  R's  default  behavior  may  be  modified  via options
#  placed in an "environment variable". This file simulates
#  the process environment.
#  This can be done  with any  option.

#  Background:
#  Under Unix: Each Process (= running Program) has a set of 
#  associated variables. The variables are called enviroment 
#  variables and, together, constitute the process environment.
#  These variables include the search path, the terminal type,
#  user's login name and user defined variables.

#  Unfortunatelly the MacOS has no equivalent. So we need 
#  a file to emulate the environment variables.
#  Name of this file is ".Renviron". It can be placed
#  in the folder "etc" of R distribution dir or in the 
#  preference folder of the system disk. 
#  If R founds the ".Renviron" file in the "etc"
#  folder of R the ".Renviron" file in the 
#  preference folder will be ignored.

#  An environment variable has a name and a value:
#  Name=Value
#  Note: Spaces are significant:
#  RKey=-r  and
#  RKey = -r are different !!!

#  Layout of this file: Comments must start with a '#'. Empty
#  lines and comments are ignored. Linebreaks of this file
#  must be in Macintosh format, DOS or Unix linebreaks will 
#  not work correctly. To check the ".Renviron" type
#  Sys.getenv() at R prompt.
#  The filename must be ".Renviron" (case insensitive). 
#  Choose your favorite editor to edit this file. 
#  Filetype and filecreator are not important.

#  Note to performance: Keep this file as small as possible.
#  Every start of R will load and parse this file.
#  You can delete all comments. (lines starting with '#')

#  All switches are case sensitive.
#  
#  Put your key environment variabile here :
#
#
# Default: RKey=DefaultValue
# just as an example...
RforMacCreator=Stefano M. Iacus

# Timezone
# Default: TZ=+0100
TZ=+0100

# The history size
# Default: RHISTSIZE=512
RHISTSIZE=512

# Undocumented feature
# R can handle user breaks to
# interrupt lengthy calculations
# or output. As this code is not
# yet optimized, by default R
# does not accept user breaks.
# If the "Interrupt" switch
# is set to TRUE then R intercept
# user breaks. With this swtich on
# R is a bit slower than with the
# switch off
# Default: Interrupt=FALSE

# Wheter to show or source a file
# You should set this to TRUE if you
# want Alpha  be your external editor
# Default: OnOpenSource=FALSE
OnOpenSource=FALSE

# The Tab size to use in text windows
# range [1,20]
# Default: TabSize=5
TabSize=5

# TextSize to be used in text windows
# range [8,14]
# Default: TextSize=12
TextSize=12

# ScreenRes
# Useful values is only 72. Possibile other values
# are 144, 300, 600 but you should not use them unless
# you know exactly what you are doing ! So, please,
# don't change this parameter.
# Default: ScreenRes=72
ScreenRes=72


# FontName: this is the font used in text windows.
# There are several possibilities for this.
# You can specify any font you like but you should
# prefere a monospaced font. If the Monaco will be used instead.
# Font names are not case sensitive i.e.
# FontName=monaco and FontName=MoNacO are the same.
# If your font name includes spaces you should provide them 
# without using quotes, i.e.
# FontName=Times New Roman
# Default: FontName=monaco
FontName=monaco

# GraphFontName: this font is used for graphic windows.
# There are several possibilities for this.
# If the font is not usable by R application, then 
# the font Helvetica will be used instead.
# Font names are not case sensitive i.e.
# FontName=monaco and FontName=MoNacO are the same.
# If your font name includes spaces you should provide them 
# without including quotes, i.e.
# FontName=Times New Roman
# Default: GraphFontName=helvetica
GraphFontName=helvetica
