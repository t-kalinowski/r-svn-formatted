		===============================

=====
* Added the Preferences panel. The settings in .Renviron
  are now superseeded by the prefences settings
  .Renviron can be still used to simulate the Environment
  for the Sys.getenv() call.
* Added the item "Link Packages Help" to the "Help" menu.
* Fixed a big that leaves help menu items ghosted after
  using them.
* Some MRC Apple's Compiler specific fixing.
* Fixed problems with current working directory in different
  points (.Rprofile, .Renviron, etc)
* Solved the problem of line endings that are different from
  MacOS and OS X. Now text files generated under both systems
  are fine to R.
* Makefiles and perl scripts have been fixed so that now R
  builds via MPW shell scripts and help files are generated
  as well.
* A bug in the internal file viewer that suppressed the "_"
  symbols from the text has been fixed.
* This version of R is slower at startup but faster than
  then previous release (by a factor of 10%) in calculations.
* The initial window at startup has been suppressed in this
  in the hope to provide am applescript analogous to pass
  initial arguments to R.
* The about box now reports informations on the current
  release of R
* Added the zlib capability so now R can manage gzipped 
  files and connentions
* Fixed some wrong links in html help files
* Finally fixed copy and paste of graphic windows contents
  and saving of them onto files. For some reason the previous
  algorithm did not copy text characters under MacOS X.
* Fixed a bug that appear when trying to reading files or
  directories on a different volume w.r.t. the current
  working directory of R.
