=====

This is the first Carbon version of R for MacOS and MacOS X.
This version IS NOT a competitor of the MacOS X version based
on the X11 device. This version will run under both MacOS and
MacOS X natively taking advantages of the new Aqua Interface
under MacOS X.
A lot of work and many changes have been done to release this
version. Even tought most of the known bugs have been fixed
it is not excluded that new ones have also been introduced.
Numerical issues has been solved, now R passes all the test.
