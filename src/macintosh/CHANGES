		Macintosh-specific changes to R
		===============================

rm150
=====

* using dev.off() when a user close a windows instead
  of killing directly the device
* changed MPWBuild to take care of changes in the src/include   
  directory
* fixed a bug with path length (Thanks to T.Lumley)    
* fixed a problem with building help files. In particular,
  html help files now have correct links
* added system() functionality under MacOS X. When R is
  running under MacOS X, it is now possibile to run BSD
  shell commands via the system() R command. Very limited
  at the moment but working.
* fixed the problem with the error message: "negative length vectors 
  are not allowed". Now you should not experiment this anymore.
* MacZip not needed anymore.
