		===============================

=====

* new scripts to build packages: makeAdd, makeRcmd, makeBio
  all the makefiles have been moved to src/macintosh/makefiles
  folder
* implemented the Quartz device (when running under OSX only)
* brand new worskspace browser, see Tools menu
* added and/or fixed internally mkdir and rmdir. Now
  unlink(), dir.create() etc work correctly
* html help handled via applescript. More stable and
  almost browser independent
* improved applescript support
* implemented browseURL
* implemented tempdir and tempfile according to Unix/Windows
  behaviour
* Date arithmetic fails (PR#1819). This bug have been partially
  fixed. Arithmetic is fine now but there is still a problem 
  with the TZ (Time Zone) settings.
* fixed a bug in Locator of Macintosh device. Now it is possible
  to interrupt it.
* From this version WasteLib 2.1x is required
