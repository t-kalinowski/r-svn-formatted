* Added the Preferences panel. The settings in .Renviron
  are now superseeded by the prefences settings
  .Renviron can be still used to simulate the Environment
  for the Sys.getenv() call.
* Added the item "Link Packages Help" to the "Help" menu.
* Fixed a bug that leaves help menu items ghosted after
  using them.
* Some MRC Apple's Compiler specific fixing.
* Fixed problems with current working directory in different
  points (.Rprofile, .Renviron, etc)
* Solved the problem of line endings that are different from
  MacOS and OS X. Now text files generated under both systems
  are fine to R.
* Makefiles and perl scripts have been fixed so that now R
  builds via MPW shell scripts and help files are generated
  as well.
* A bug in the internal file viewer that suppressed the "_"
  symbols from the text has been fixed.
* This version of R is slower at startup but faster than
  then previous release (by a factor of 10%) in calculations.
* The initial window at startup has been suppressed in this
  release in the hope to provide am applescript analogous to 
  pass initial arguments to R.
* The about box now reports informations on the current
  release of R
* Added the zlib capability so now R can manage gzipped 
  files and connentions
* Fixed some wrong links in html help files
* Finally fixed copy and paste of graphic windows contents
  and saving of them onto files. For some reason the previous
  algorithm did not copy text characters under MacOS X.
* Fixed a bug that appear when trying to reading files or
  directories on a different volume w.r.t. the current
  working directory of R.
* Added two functions file.edit() and new.file().
  The file.edit() function is similar to file.show() but
  let the user edit the opened file. It it the equivalent
  to the menu command "Open File for Editing..." while
  new.file() is the equivalent to the "New Window" menu
  command with the difference that you can specify the
  name of the new file to edit. For more details see
  man pages.
* Added three functions to manipulate a User menu in the
  R Console menubar. With add.menu.cmd(label,command) the
  user can add menu item "label" to which is associated
  an R command. Respectively with del.menu.cmd(label) and
  get.menu.cmd(label) the user can remove or get the
  command associated to the menu "label". See the help
  pages for details and examples.
* Added three functions to manipulate a User menu in the
  R Console menubar. With del.usr.cmd() the whole user
  menu is removed. Respectively with del.num.cmd(menunum) 
  and get.num.cmd(menunum) the user can remove or get the
  command associated to the menu numbered "menunum". See 
  the help pages for details and examples.
* Fixed some problems with windows naming (duplicates
  and so forth)
* Windows (both text and graphic) now appears only after
  repositioning
* lwd parameter in graphic functions re-implemented even
  if not yet perfectly working.
* lty & lwd paramter now works for all the graphic call
  apart for Circle.
* fixed a bug in the function edit(). Now it behaves 
  correctly. If you call it without parameters, the
  last temporary edited file will be shown. See man
  pages of edit(). Consequently it is now fixed the
  problem with the function fix().
* Refresh of graphic windows fixed. One time only and
  the bottom part of the window is correctly redrawn.

=====
* Added the "Config" menu
* Fixed a bug in the lapack module. Complex functions are now
  available.
* Added MPW makefiles to build standard libraries and modules 
* Added experimental script to build R via Apple's MRC compiler
* Now R needs a new shared library "f2c" lib that will increase
  portability for all fortran based packages
* Added support for apple events. R begins to be a scriptable
  application. Very limited support by now but will increase soon.
  Some demo scripts have been added.
* link.html.help() function has been added by picking windows code.



rm130
=====
* Fixed a bug when saving from menus
* Added module support
* Fixed a bug that crashes R under System 8.6 due to a calling
  to a non-existent function under 8.6
* Stack and memory settings changed to work on System 8.6
* R main project file and packages project files have been changed
* Added back the "Save" menu
* file.choose() works correctly now
* Now R takes track of file names associated to each window
* Fixed a bug with printer dialog
* Now R can handle "user breaks" in evaluation and printing loops

This is the first Carbon version of R for MacOS and MacOS X.
This version IS NOT a competitor of the MacOS X version based
on the X11 device. This version will run under both MacOS and
MacOS X natively taking advantages of the new Aqua Interface
under MacOS X.
A lot of work and many changes have been done to release this
version. Even tought most of the known bugs have been fixed
it is not excluded that new ones have also been introduced.
Numerical issues has been solved, now R passes all the test.
  
Macintosh porting of R-1.2.3,  (April 26 2001).
=====================================================
* first Carbon version of R for MacOS and MacOS X
* cut and paste bug fixed
* external editor interaction implemented
* gui rewritten and added help menu
* macintosh device rewritten
* adoption of navigation services for file dialogs
* several minor bugs fixed (see the on-line help)
* no longer needs a copy of the WasteLib library on the
  user hard disk
* ATSUI technology has been adopted to render text in
  the graphic device
* R is partly configurable via the .Renviron file
* numerical issues fixed, now R passes all the tests

Macintosh porting of R-1.2.2,  (Feb 26 2001).
=====================================================
* the GUi is now organized better. It also possibile
  to "source" files by menus.
* sources have been merged with the standard distribution
* the InfoZip code has been eliminated. Now it is assumed
  that the external MacZip application is available. If
  not, R asks the user to install it.
* implemented the startup command line
* re-direction of stdin/stdout implemented. Useful to 
  make checks.
* several bugs fixed. In particular one "malloc"
  memory bug has been removed.

Macintosh porting of R-1.2.1,  beta 2, (Jan 19 2001).
=====================================================
* getenv() in now working. The .Renviron file is assumed
  to be in "etc" directory 
* "etc" is assumed to contain the history file, the image
  session and the environments variables
* a new command line has been added. It is possible to
  specify options as in the Unix/Win implementations
* packages have been recompiled
* few other bugs fixed

What's new from R for Mac R-1.2.0,  beta 1, (Jan 07 2001).
==========================================================
* dir.create() now implemented
* help.start() now works. It launches the default browser associated to the
   file extension "htm" and/or "html". The same behaviour as nder Windows
   systems.
* internal unzip implemented using InfoZip

What's new from R for Mac R-1.1.1,  beta 1, (Dec 10 2000).
==========================================================
Sources for MacOS avalaible!
This version is only an update to version 1.2.0 of R sources.
This is intended to release sources for MacOS developers.

* memory allocation problems have been fixed.

* Packages have been rebuilt to version 1.2.0.

* proc.time and system.time are now partially implemented. They
  give results in seconds only for total system time and process time.
  The system time is calculated as the number of seconds passed
  from booting your machine.

* Memory settings are now ignored since from version 1.2.0 of R
   there is no more (really) a need to fix VSize and NSize.
   If R runs out of memory it only suffices to increment the Memory
   of the "R application" from the Finder. The default is set to 25Mb
   but you can change it as you prefer up to the maximum of the
   memory currently  avalaible on your Macintosh system.

* the Sys.timezone() implemented by a trick. The timezone
  string can be read from the system but not set. The function
  getenv still doesn't exists on Macintosh.

* command history is now saved and loaded. do_savehistory and
  do_loadhistory fully implemented.


Macintosh porting of R-1.1.1,  beta 1, (Dec 10 2000)
====================================================

* tempfile() is now supported. Temporary files are stored in a directory
  "tmp" that it is assumed to be in the main R folder. If it doesn't
  exist, R create it. All temporary files will be stored there.

* unlink() is implemented. It can delete only files and dirs created
  from the current R session. Wildcards not allowed yet.

* Dynamic libraries are fully implemented grace to the code give to me
  by Luke Tierney. 
  (There is a problem with DLLName. Every function must be searched
   for global and not for a specific package when calling .C/.Fortran etc)

* Most of the packages have been compiled but the tclk one.

* tclk demos disabled

* Packages. The following packages have been compiled or simply added
  to the base one:

  ctest (ex:tested)
  eda (ex:tested)
  lqs (ex:tested)
  modreg (ex:tested)
  mva (ex:tested)
  nls (ex:tested, does not work "SSlogis")
  splines (ex:tested)
  stepfun (ex:tested)
  ts (file AnIndex to be built)
  wavethresh (examples and help files to be built)

* Metric Information for graphics device partially working.
  You can write expressions and symbols in plots but it is not yet
  perfectly working.
 
* data(women) doesn't load! Can't understand why...yet.

* XDR loading/saving has been implemented. I use the code from B. Ripley
  that (seems) to work fine with very little modifications.

* Load and Save of image is now implemented correctly. 

* Load and Save implemented from menu too. If you save from menu an icon
  will be added to the file. You can double-click on a R file to start the
  application or load a file in R if the application is running. You can
  also  drag&drop the file on the R icon to launch R.

* Help files are now displayed correctly with colors as under Windows


What else still remains to do!
==============================
There are lots of things that have to be implemented and fixed.
Not all the avalaible packages have been compiled. If you have any
particular need please let me know and I will compile and made
available the package. There is not an automatic install procedure
for building packages under MacOS yet.

This current version containes wavethresh and multiv packages but no
help files and examples are avalaible yet.
If you need them you should only copy the directories "help" and "R-ex" 
of the Windows distribution in their respectively directory under this
distribution.
