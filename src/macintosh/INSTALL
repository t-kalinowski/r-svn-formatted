Macintosh porting of R
======================

In this directory you can find all the files needed to compile a
specific version of R for MacOS.  The original code for MacOS was
written by Ross Ihaka, Julian Harris and Wing Kwong (Tiki) Wan. More
recently Stefan Iacus has modified or simply updated most of the files
to work with current versions of R sources and the Waste Text Engine.

Before building R
=================

There are only two files that must be uncompressed before
starting compiling R. These are

src/macintosh/res/R.rsrc.hqx	-  the R application resource file
src/macintosh/cwpro/R.mcp.hqx	-  the CodeWarrior Project file

and you need to expand them via any hqx decoding utility.

Some files need to be created on a Unix/Linux platform. Unpack the
sources on such a platform  and run (you will probably need GNU make)

	cd src/macintosh
	make
	make distribution

and then copy the file dist.zip to the Macintosh and unpack it at the
top level of the R sources.  It creates the library folder, and adds
files in doc/html and some header files in src/macintosh.


Building R
==========

The R binary can be compiled using Code Warrior Pro 6, called CW
subsequently, by simply opening the file "R.mcp" in the "cwpro" directory.
To build the R application you need version 2.x of the Waste Library
by Marco Piovanelli. This should be included in the CW6 distribution.
In case you don't have this, please download the full archive at the
official Waste library site,  http://www.merzwaren.com/waste.

You also need a fortran compiler or an F2C tool to compile the
*.f fortran files in src/appl directory.
The R.mcp project assumes that you have converted the files with F2C
and put the *.c sources in /src/appl/mac_f2c directory.


Once you have built the R application, copy the "R" binary
from "src/macintosh/bin" in the folder
where you put also the "library" directory (with all
packages built), the "afm", "demos" and "tests"
directories. The distribution folder should appear as

afm/		(dir)
demo/		(dir)
library/	(dir)
R		(file)
tests/		(dir)

Before building R :
===================

1) Please copy the file "src/include/macintosh/config.mac.h" to
   "src/include/config.h" before you build the R application.

2) if you do not use F2C you need a Fortran compiler
   and also to change the R.mcp project.


Building packages
=================

To build compiled code for the standard packages, refer to the
respective "src/<pkg>/src/macintosh/" directory where you can find a
CW project.  Once you have built a package you should move the
resulting file to the "libs" directory in the "library/package"
folder.

There is still no "makefile" to build the R application, configure it,
build help and doc files etc.  You can take the help and examples files
from the Windows version by simply copying the whole directories
{help, html, R-ex} from the Windows distribution to the pacakge
directory here.

At present this applies to the data and R directories too.


Futher directions
=================

Most of the files in the src/macintosh directory are only partially
commented. This will change in the near future. The GUI sources are adapted
from the WasteDemo application from the Waste Text Engine distribution.
Thanks to Marco Piovanelli for providing these sources for free.

Note that the process of building R for the Macintosh is still not
satisfactory to us, and we are working on improvements.
