  In Pascal, an "intf" file is sorta like a .h (header) file in C: it
  contains a lot of the declarations and definitions of things used
  in general by the entirity of the code.

  Most of the code from the WEDemoIntf.p file has been placed into
  the WEDemoHeader.h file except for some general purpose utility
  functions, which have then been placed here.
