We are currently writing this.

<p><hr WIDTH="100%">

<FONT FACE="Times"><P>Macintosh porting of R-1.2.1,  beta 1, (Gen 19 2001).</P>
<P>=====================================================</P>
<P>* getenv() in now working. The .Renviron file is assumed</P>
<P>  to be in "etc" directory </P>
<P>* "etc" is assumed to contain the history file, the image</P>
<P>  session and the environments variables</P>
<P>* a new command line has been added. It is possible to</P>
<P>  specify options as in the Unix/Win implementations</P>
<P>* packages have been recompiled</P>
<P>* few other bugs fixed</P>

<P>What's new from R for Mac R-1.2.0,  beta 1, (Jan 07 2001).</P>
<P>==========================================================</P>
<P>* dir.create() now implemented</P>
<P>* help.start() now works. It launches the default browser 
associated to the</P>
<P>   file extension "htm" and/or "html". The same behaviour as nder 
Windows</P>
<P>   systems.</P>
<P>* internal unzip implemented using InfoZip</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What's new from R for Mac R-1.1.1,  beta 1, (Dec 10 2000).</P>
<P>==========================================================</P>
<P>Sources for MacOS avalaible!</P>
<P>This version is only an update to version 1.2.0 of R sources.</P>
<P>This is intended to release sources for MacOS developers.</P>

<P>* memory allocation problems have been fixed.</P>

<P>* Packages have been rebuilt to version 1.2.0.</P>

<P>* proc.time and system.time are now partially implemented. They</P>
<P>  give results in seconds only for total system time and process time.</P>
<P>  The system time is calculated as the number of seconds passed</P>
<P>  from booting your machine.</P>

<P>* Memory settings are now ignored since from version 1.2.0 of R</P>
<P>   there is no more (really) a need to fix VSize and NSize.</P>
<P>   If R runs out of memory it only suffices to increment the Memory</P>
<P>   of the "R application" from the Finder. The default is set to 25Mb</P>
<P>   but you can change it as you prefer up to the maximum of the</P>
<P>   memory currently  avalaible on your Macintosh system.</P>

<P>* the Sys.timezone() implemented by a trick. The timezone</P>
<P>  string can be read from the system but not set. The function</P>
<P>  getenv still doesn't exists on Macintosh.</P>

<P>* command history is now saved and loaded. do_savehistory and</P>
<P>  do_loadhistory fully implemented.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Macintosh porting of R-1.1.1,  beta 1, (Dec 10 2000)</P>
<P>====================================================</P>

<P>* tempfile() is now supported. Temporary files are stored in a directory</P>
<P>  "tmp" that it is assumed to be in the main R folder. If it doesn't</P>
<P>  exist, R create it. All temporary files will be stored there.</P>

<P>* unlink() is implemented. It can delete only files and dirs created</P>
<P>  from the current R session. Wildcards not allowed yet.</P>

<P>* Dynamic libraries are fully implemented grace to the code give to me</P>
<P>  by Luke Tierney. </P>
<P>  (There is a problem with DLLName. Every function must be searched</P>
<P>   for global and not for a specific package when calling 
.C/.Fortran etc)</P>

<P>* Most of the packages have been compiled but the tclk one.</P>

<P>* tclk demos disabled</P>

<P>* Packages. The following packages have been compiled or simply added</P>
<P>  to the base one:</P>

<P>  ctest (ex:tested)</P>
<P>  eda (ex:tested)</P>
<P>  lqs (ex:tested)</P>
<P>  modreg (ex:tested)</P>
<P>  mva (ex:tested)</P>
<P>  nls (ex:tested, does not work "SSlogis")</P>
<P>  splines (ex:tested)</P>
<P>  stepfun (ex:tested)</P>
<P>  ts (file AnIndex to be built)</P>
<P>  wavethresh (examples and help files to be built)</P>

<P>* Metric Information for graphics device partially working.</P>
<P>  You can write expressions and symbols in plots but it is not yet</P>
<P>  perfectly working.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>* data(women) doesn't load! Can't understand why...yet.</P>

<P>* XDR loading/saving has been implemented. I use the code from B. Ripley</P>
<P>  that (seems) to work fine with very little modifications.</P>

<P>* Load and Save of image is now implemented correctly. </P>

<P>* Load and Save implemented from menu too. If you save from menu an icon</P>
<P>  will be added to the file. You can double-click on a R file to 
start the</P>
<P>  application or load a file in R if the application is running. You can</P>
<P>  also  drag&amp;drop the file on the R icon to launch R.</P>

<P>* Help files are now displayed correctly with colors as under Windows</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What else still remains to do!</P>
<P>==============================</P>
<P>There are lots of things that have to be implemented and fixed.</P>
<P>Not all the avalaible packages have been compiled. If you have any</P>
<P>particular need please let me know and I will compile and made</P>
<P>available the package. There is not an automatic install procedure</P>
<P>for building packages under MacOS yet.</P>

<P>This current version containes wavethresh and multiv packages but no</P>
<P>help files and examples are avalaible yet.</P>
<P>If you need them you should only copy the directories "help" and "R-ex" </P>
<P>of the Windows distribution in their respectively directory under this</P>
<P>distribution.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hystory</P>
<P>=======</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What was in R for Mac pre-alpha 2 and 1</P>
<P>=======================================</P>
<P>* dir, setcwd, getcwd</P>
<P>* macdevice pdated to WasteLib 2.0 </P>
