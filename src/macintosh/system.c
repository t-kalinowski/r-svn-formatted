/*
 *  SYSTEM DEPENDENT CODE
 *
 *  This source file contains the platform dependent code for
 *  the Macintosh port of R.
 *
 *  The first group of functions is concerned with reading and
 *  writing to the system console.
 *
 *    int   R_ReadConsole(char *prompt, char *buf, int buflen, int hist)
 *
 *  This function prints the given prompt at the console and then
 *  does a gets(3)-like operation, transfering up to "buflen" characters
 *  into the buffer "buf".  The last two characters are set to "\n\0"
 *  to preserve sanity.	 If "hist" is non-zero, then the line is added
 *  to any command history which is being maintained.  Note that this
 *  is one natural place from which to run an event loop.
 *
 *    void  R_WriteConsole(char *buf, int buflen)
 *
 *  This function writes the given buffer out to the console.  No
 *  special actions are required.  Under Unix the characters are
 *  just appended to stdout.
 *
 *    void  R_ResetConsole(void)
 *
 *  This function is called when the system is reset after an error.
 *  It probably isn't really needed.
 *
 *    void  R_FlushConsole(void)
 *
 *  This called to flush any output to the system console.  Under Unix
 *  this is just fflush(stdout).  Other systems may not need this.
 *
 *    void  R_ClearerrConsole(void)
 *
 *  This function clears any errors associated with reading from the
 *  console.  In Unix is is used to clear any EOF condition associated
 *  with stdin.
 *
 *    void  R_Suicide(char *msg)
 *
 *  This function displays the given message and the causes R to
 *  die immediately.  It is used for non-recoverable errors such as
 *  not having enough memory to launch etc.  The phrase "dialog box"
 *  springs to mind for non-unix platforms.
 *
 *    void  R_Busy(int which)
 *
 *  This function invokes actions (such as change of cursor) when
 *  R embarks on an extended computation (which=1) and when such a
 *  state terminates (which=0).
 *
 *    void  R_CleanUp(int ask)
 *
 *  This function invokes any actions which occur at system termination.
 *
 *    char* R_ExpandFileName(char *s)
 *
 *  This is a utility function which can be used to expand special
 *  characters in file names.  In Unix it's sole function is to expand
 *  and "~"s which occur in filenames (and then only when the readline
 *  library is available.  The minimal action is to return the argument
 *  unaltered.
 *
 *    void  R_InitialData(void)
 *    FILE* R_OpenInitFile(void)
 *    FILE* R_OpenLibraryFile(char *file)
 *    FILE* R_OpenSysInitFile(void)
 *
 *  The following two functions save and restore the user's global
 *  environment.  The system specific aspect of this what files
 *  are used for this.
 *
 *    void  R_RestoreGlobalEnv(void)
 *    void  R_SaveGlobalEnv(void)
 *
 *  Platform dependent functions.
 *
 *    SEXP  do_interactive(SEXP call, SEXP op, SEXP args, SEXP rho)
 *    SEXP  do_machine(SEXP call, SEXP op, SEXP args, SEXP rho)
 *    SEXP  do_proctime(SEXP call, SEXP op, SEXP args, SEXP rho)
 *    SEXP  do_quit(SEXP call, SEXP op, SEXP args, SEXP rho)
 *    SEXP  do_system(SEXP call, SEXP op, SEXP args, SEXP rho)
