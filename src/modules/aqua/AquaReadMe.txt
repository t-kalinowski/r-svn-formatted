ReadMe file for installation of the AQUA - Darwin R


The final installation should have the following structure

R.app/
		Contents/
					Info.plist #
					PkgInfo #
					MacOS/
					Resources/ #
								main.nib/
											classes.nib
											info.nib
											objects.xib
								RLogo.icns
								
Where the "Contents" directory is in fact the "R_Home" directory 
and the "MacOS" is the "bin" directory.

The Contents directory contains the items marked with "#".
So at installation time same care is needed.

More instruction will be available soon.
