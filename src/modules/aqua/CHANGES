CHANGES IN R (AQUA) VERSION 1.9.0



NEW FEATURES
    o   The refresh of the aqua console is now faster than before an 
        buffering of R output is enabled by default even if the user 
        can't set it. The preferences panel no longer contains the 
        entries for setting the amount of the buffer size and the 
        checkbox for enabling/disablig this option.

    o   Dy default, the Aqua console now opens to the left-top of the
        screen unless differently set in the preferences file of the 
        R.app. The last position of Console and its size are now saved 
        in the preferences file when R quits and reused at R statup  
        by default. The user can disable this functionality using the 
        checkbox in the Text Windows pane of preferences window.

    o   By default, the quartz device now opens to the top-right 
        position on the screen. The user can override this setting 
        choosing among five different solutions in the quartz device 
        tab in the preferences window.

    o   Console font: now the user can only choose among 5 different 
        fixed width fonts. Fonts size and Tab size can now be choosen
        using the appropriate popup menu buttons in the preference 
        window.

    o   Edit and Help windows now opens at the right top position on 
        the screen. They are also 80 chars-width sized to contain by 
        default R man pages.

    o   Resizing of the R Console Window changes the "width" option by
        default unless the user disables this functionality in the 
        preference panel
	
BUG FIXES

    o   Mathematical symbols in plots are now displayed correctly
        under Jaguar (MacOSX 1.2.x) and Panther (MacOSX 10.3.x). 
        Unicode encoding of the symbol font used under Panther is now
        translated correctly to work as a MacRoman encoded font.

    o   The redefinition of the internal do_dataentry by both the aqua
        and X11 modules, casued a bus error when launching R without 
        the --gui=aqua option under X11 using a version of R built to
        use the aqua module. This has now been fixed. (PR#6438)
	
    o   The locator and identify process can now be interrupted by 
        pressing the ESC key. Labels of the identified points now shows
        correctly and not just in the end of the identify process. Bell
        sound has been implemented as well.

    o   The font colors are now set correctly in the input frame after 
        preferences changes

	o   The cpu usage was very high in previous releases of R (Aqua) 
        due to idle timers implementation. Now removed with a new 
        internal design to refresh the Aqua console.

	o   Saving the content of a quartz graphics device and then 
        resizing caused a crash (PR#1991). Now fixed.

INSTALLATION CHANGES
    o   The defaults for configure for Darwin systems is
        --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack --with-aqua
        that by default builds R as a framework and installs it in
        /Library/Frameworks as R.framework. Then, make install just
        installs the R.framework in /Library/Frameworks unless 
        specified at configure time using the -enable-R-framework=[DIR]
        or using the --prefix flag at installation time.
