CHANGES IN R (AQUA) VERSION 1.9.0



NEW FEATURES

    o   Dy default, the Aqua console now opens to the left-top of the screen 
        unless differently set in the preferences file of the R.app. The last 
        position of Console and its size are now saved in the preferences file 
        when R quits and reused at R statup  by default. The user can disable this
        functionality using the checkbox in the misc pane of preferences window.

    o   By default, the quartz device now opens to the top-right position on
        the screen. The user can override this setting choosing among 5 different
        solution in the quartz device pane in the preferences window.

    o   Console font: now the user can only choose among 5 different fixed width
        fonts. Fonts size and Tab size can now be choosen using the appropriate
        popup menu buttons in the preference window.

    o   Edit and Help windows now opens at the right top position on the screen.

    o   Resizing of the R Console Window changes the "width" option by default
        unless the user disables this functionality in the preference panel
	
BUG FIXES

    o   Mathematical symbols in plots are now displayed correctly under
        Jaguar (MacOSX 1.2.x) and Panther (MacOSX 10.3.x). Unicode encoding 
        of the symbol font used under Panther is now translated correctly to
        work as a MacRoman encoded font.

    o   The redefinition of the internal do_dataentry by both the aqua and X11
        modules, casued a bus error when launching R without the --gui=aqua option
        under X11 using a version of R built to use the aqua module. This has
        now been fixed. (PR#6438)
	
    o   the locator and identify process can now be interrupted by pressing the
        ESC key. Labels of the identified points now shows correctly and not just
        in the end of the identify process. Bell sound has been implemented as well.

    o   the font colors are now set correctly in the input frame after preferences
        changes

INSTALLATION CHANGES
    o   The defaults for configure for Darwin systems is
        --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack --with-aqua
        that by default builds R as a framework and installs it in
        /Library/Frameworks as R.framework. Then, make install just
        installs the R.framework in /Library/Frameworks unless specified
        at configure time using the -enable-R-framework=[DIR] or using
        the --prefix flag at installation time.
