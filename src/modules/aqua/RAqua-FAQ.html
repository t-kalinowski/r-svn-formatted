Iacus</i><p>For the time being please refer to the <ahref="http://www.economia.unimi.it/R/">RAqua developer page</a>.A complete DOC/FAQ page will be available soon here.<h3>Panther notes</h3>After installing Panther (MacOSX 10.3) it turns out that package installation (either from sources or from binaries) can fail. If you get an error <i>like</i> this (this comes from source package installation)<br><br><tt>dyld: gcc version mismatch for library: /usr/local/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version of user: 5.0.0 greater than library's version: 4.0.0)</tt><br><br>i.e. you get an incompatibility error for the <b>libiconv</b> library, this is probably due to the fact that you have the <b>libiconv</b> dll in the <tt>/usr/local/lib</tt> path. This library is installed with the "<b>libwmf+iconv</b>" package which is a recommended one in the distribution of teTex that comes from the <i>i-installer 2</i>. Panther command line tools (i.e. GNU tar, gcc, etc) need the version of libiconv that  the MacOSX 10.3 installer puts inside <tt>/usr/lib</tt> which is a newer version.<h4>The fix</h4>Just remove the "<b>"libwmf+iconv</b>" package using i-installer.Thanks to Thomas Lumley for spotting this.<h4>Could I build R/Raqua on my own?</h4>Sure you can, but you need to setup you system first.
