<H1><A NAME="SEC1">Introduction</A></H1>
<P>
This is a very first try of writing a R for Mac OS X. I hope to finish it in time for R-1.9.0.
In any case, please send me requests/questions you would like answers on.


<P>
 




<H2><A NAME="SEC2">How many versions of R for Mac OS X?</A></H2>

<P>
There is currently only one version of R for Mac OS X.
But R on Mac OS X can be used as a command-line application (see section <A HREF="RMacOSX-FAQ.html#SEC15">Command line version of R</A>), like on any
other unix-like system, or via the Aqua GUI (see section <A HREF="RMacOSX-FAQ.html#SEC16">R with Aqua GUI</A>). This second approach in using R
for Mac OS X is mostly preferred by "traditional" Macintosh users.




<H2><A NAME="SEC3">What machines does R for Mac OS X run on?</A></H2>

<P>
R for Mac OS X requires Mac OS X version 10.2 or higher to run. The latest version of the system is
always preferable though. We do not support Mac OS X version 10.1.




<H2><A NAME="SEC4">Building R from sources</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="SEC5">What is needed to build R</A></H2>



<H3><A NAME="SEC6">the C/C++ compiler gcc 3.3</A></H3>
<P>
If you have Mac OS X 10.3 (aka Panther) you just need to install the software inside the Xcode Tools CD 
(which is CD number 4). This is only true if you bought Panther. In most of the cases you have 
Panther already installed on your brand new machine, which means that you don't have the forth 
Developer CD. You should take it from Apple Developer Connection site (see section <A HREF="RMacOSX-FAQ.html#SEC39">Apple Developer Connection</A>): in the
download section, look for Xcode Tools v 1.1 or above.


<P>
If you are using Mac OS X 10.2 (aka Jaguar) then you should download and install the 
Apple Developers Tools Dec 2002 including the latest updates which dates August 2003. Either it comes 
on a separate CD with your Mac, either you can download these  from the Apple Developer Connection site (see section <A HREF="RMacOSX-FAQ.html#SEC39">Apple Developer Connection</A>)
In either cases be sure you have gcc version 3.3 just by typing in a Terminal window 

<PRE>
gcc -vv
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC7">the Fortran compiler g77 for gcc 3.3</A></H3>
<P>
You need to install a version of the g77 Fortran compiler which is built for gcc 3.3. 
The following instructions apply to binaries coming from  HPC for Mac OS X page <A HREF="http://hpc.sourceforge.net">http://hpc.sourceforge.net</A>. 
Please take care: there are two versions of the g77 binaries, one for Jaguar and one for Panther. 
Use the appropriate one.


<P>
Once you have the binaries, please do the following (you'll be asked for a root password):
cd to the download folder and type

<PRE>
sudo tar -zxvf g77v3.4-bin.tar.gz -C /
rehash
</PRE>

<P>
It installs everything in <EM>/usr/local</EM>. The name of the .tar.gz archive can be different, see the related web page.




<H3><A NAME="SEC8">the libreadline 4.3 (optional)</A></H3>
<P>
This library is optional. 
You need this library to be able to retrive history using use arrow keys or for tab completion of filenames
when you run R as a command line tool. The original source archive is located at GNU Org web page <A HREF="ftp://www.gnu.org">ftp://www.gnu.org</A>. 
You need to modify the original file <EM>shlib/Makefile.in</EM> in order to make it
work under MacOS X 10.2.x and later (this is because libreadline needs to be linked against
<EM>-lncurses -lcc_dynamic</EM>). If you can do better at configure time working on the original archive 
let me know. I suggest you to download my patched version from <A HREF="http://www.economia.unimi.it/R">http://www.economia.unimi.it/R</A>. 
Once you have done, please do the following (you'll be asked for a root password):
uncompress the archive, cd inside the folder and type the following

<PRE>
./configure
make
sudo make install
</PRE>

<P>
It installs everything in <EM>/usr/local</EM>.
These instructions apply to both Jaguar and Panther.




<H3><A NAME="SEC9">the X11 window server (optional)</A></H3>
<P>
If you have Panther, you probably have the X11 Window server already installed on your system. 
This is what you need to run a version of R with the capability of using the X11 device, but it isn't sufficient
if you want to build it.
You need to install the additional X11 SDK package from the Xcode Tools CD. 
Please note: the installer on the Xcode Tools CD does not install the X11 SDK by default: 
you should look inside the Xcode Tools CD and install manually the X11 SDK.


<P>
If you have Jaguar, you'll need to install both the X11 Window server and the X11 SDK package from 
the XFree86 web page.  Apple site only supports the latest version of his OS (at the moment Panther).
Users report that other version of X11 Window Servers (other than the one distributed by Apple) work as well.




<H3><A NAME="SEC10">the TclTk 8.4 headers and libraries (optional)</A></H3>
<P>
You need to download the sources of the Tcl and Tk 8.4.x packages to build yourself the sources. 
The original sources can be found on the official TclTk web page <A HREF="http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/8.4.html">http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/8.4.html</A>.
Please do the following respecting the sequence (you'll be asked for a root password). These are examples for version 8.4.4
of the Tcl and Tk sources, you'll probably find new version on the web page, thus only the name of the .tar.gz archives
changes.


<P>
For Tcl: download the tlc 8.4 sources, cd inside the folder where you have downloaded the archive and
type:

<PRE>
tar zxf tcl8.4.4-src.tar.gz
cd tcl8.4.4/unix/
./configure
make
sudo make install
</PRE>

<P>
For Tk: download the tk 8.4 sources, cd inside the folder where you have downloaded the archive and type:

<PRE>
tar zxf tk8.4.4-src.tar.gz
cd tk8.4.4/unix/
./configure
make
sudo make install
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC11">a TeX suite of tools for documentation (optional)</A></H3>
<P>
There is a nice installer, called the i-installer II, that allows you to install a complete 
teTeX distribution. You can find details on the i-installer at <A HREF="http://www.rna.nl/ii.html">http://www.rna.nl/ii.html</A>. 
The teTeX is one of the i-Packages.




<H2><A NAME="SEC12">How to configure and build R</A></H2>
<P>
Download the latest sources of R from @CRAN{}. Unpack the archive with tar -zxf <EM>name_of_R_sources_archive</EM> and cd
inside the R sources directory. Then you need to configure R for your system and build R. 
Just type

<PRE>
./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack --with-aqua 
make
</PRE>

<P>
This will configure R to be built as a Framework to be installed inside your <EM>/Library/Frameworks</EM> directory with the name 
<EM>R.framework</EM>. You can change the default location of the <EM>R.framework</EM> 
installation at configure time by specifying the flag <EM>--enable-R-framework[=DIR]</EM>, i.e. 
with something like

<PRE>
./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack 
            --with-aqua --enable-R-framework=FOO
</PRE>

<P>
and the final destination of the <EM>R.framework</EM> will be <EM>FOO/R.framework</EM>, which means that you 
don't have to specify the <EM>R.framework</EM> text in the path. 




<H2><A NAME="SEC13">How to install R</A></H2>
<P>
A standard installation of R requires you have built it as a Framework. At this point just type (a root 
password will be required):

<PRE>
sudo make install
</PRE>

<P>
and all will be installed in <EM>/Library/Frameworks</EM>.
You can decide to change the R.framework destination by using the <EM>--prefix</EM> option specifying the final destination.
As in the above, you don't need to specify the name <EM>R.framework</EM> in the path.




<H2><A NAME="SEC14">How to build and install the Aqua GUI</A></H2>
<P>
At the moment, there is nothing to  do to build the Aqua GUI.
You just need to install it using

<PRE>
make install-aqua
</PRE>

<P>
and it will install the <EM>R.app</EM> application in the <EM>Applications</EM> folder on your system.




<H1><A NAME="SEC15">Command line version of R</A></H1>
<P>
The command line version of R is nothing but a classic unix-like implementation of R. So general documentation for R applies
to this version as well.
On each release (and patched-release) ready to use binaries are distributed through @CRAN{}.
Thies binaries come with a common installer used by R with Aqua GUI so please read
the releated notes (see section <A HREF="RMacOSX-FAQ.html#SEC17">How to get R with Aqua GUI</A>).
To use R you probably need to add a symbolic link on your System as the R binary is located inside the framework.
Suppose you have the <EM>/usr/local/bin</EM> directory on your System, than you should just type in your Terminal (a root password is required)

<PRE>
sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R 
           /usr/local/bin/R
</PRE>

<P>
Assuming that you have <EM>/usr/local/bin</EM> in your <EM>PATH</EM> environment variable, you'll be able to launch R from any location
on your System just by typing <EM>R</EM>.
In this way, when you install a new version of the <EM>R.framework</EM> this link will point to the latest R binary.




<H1><A NAME="SEC16">R with Aqua GUI</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC17">How to get R with Aqua GUI</A></H2>
<P>
The <TT>`bin/macosx'</TT> directory of a @CRAN{} site contains a standard
Apple installer package named <TT>`R.dmg.sit'</TT> compressed in Aladdin
Stuffit format.  Once downloaded, uncompressed and executed, the
installer will install the current non-developer release of R.  R  is
a native Mac OS X Darwin version of R with an Aqua GUI. 
Inside
<TT>`bin/macosx/<VAR>x</VAR>.<VAR>y</VAR>'</TT> there are prebuilt binary packages to
be used with R corresponding to the "<VAR>x</VAR>.<VAR>y</VAR>" release of
R. The installation of these packages is available through the
"Package" menu of the Aqua GUI (see section <A HREF="RMacOSX-FAQ.html#SEC28">Packages Menu</A>). 




<H2><A NAME="SEC18">How to install the Aqua GUI</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="SEC19">The R Console</A></H2>



<H3><A NAME="SEC20">The Input and the Output</A></H3>
<P>
The current desing of the R Console is to have separate frames for input (user) and output (R).
The user is supposed to type command into the bottom frame of the R Console, this input is echoed
into the upper frame and R will give any related output in the upper frame.
The output frame (the upper one) is a read-only frame. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC21">Copy and Paste</A></H3>
<P>
Copy and paste works in R as in any other Macintosh application.
But when two selection are active: one in the output frame and one in the input frame, the output frame takes precedence 
when copying to the clipboard.
You can also copy from the <EM>quartz()</EM> graphic device (see section <A HREF="RMacOSX-FAQ.html#SEC37">Quartz device</A>) to the clipboard. In this case a bitmap image is
created. If you want high resolution graphic exports, you should better save the image using the <EM>File/Save as</EM> menu item (see section <A HREF="RMacOSX-FAQ.html#SEC37">Quartz device</A>).




<H3><A NAME="SEC22">The current and startup working directories</A></H3>
<P>
If not otherwise specified in the Preferences (see section <A HREF="RMacOSX-FAQ.html#SEC30">Preferences</A>), or if the specified path is no longer available, then
the default working directory at startup is the user home.
The working directory can be changed using the <EM>setwd</EM> R command or using the <EM>Tools</EM> menut item <EM>Change working directory</EM>.
The current working directory is displayed on the main bar of the R Console window.
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC23">Resizing the R Console</A></H3>
<P>
When the R Console Window is resized, the R option <EM>width</EM> is set appropriately so that any future
output will fit the window size. This behaviour can be inihibited using the Preferences settings (see section <A HREF="RMacOSX-FAQ.html#SEC30">Preferences</A>).
On closing the R application, the position and the size of the R Console window are saved in the Preferences and reused
next time you launch R. You can inihibit R to do this using the appropriate Preferences settings.




<H3><A NAME="SEC24">Input and Output text colors</A></H3>
<P>
Text windows and frames are divided in Read-Only and Read and Write ones. Text colors can be set separately
for the two kinds of windows. This happens as well for their respectives backgrounds. Use the Preferences window to set these 
colors (see section <A HREF="RMacOSX-FAQ.html#SEC30">Preferences</A>).




<H2><A NAME="SEC25">The Menus</A></H2>



<H3><A NAME="SEC26">Tools Menu</A></H3>



<H3><A NAME="SEC27">Workspace Menu</A></H3>



<H3><A NAME="SEC28">Packages Menu</A></H3>



<H3><A NAME="SEC29">The Help menu</A></H3>
<P>
Using this menu you can open the on-line manuals (<EM>R Help</EM>), read this FAQ and  review the latest changes, bug fixes and new features of R for Mac OS X (<EM>What's new in this version</EM>).
There are also interfaces to the R <EM>help</EM> and <EM>help.search</EM> functions as well as the <EM>example</EM> function. 




<H2><A NAME="SEC30">Preferences</A></H2>



<H3><A NAME="SEC31">Text Windows tab</A></H3>



<H3><A NAME="SEC32">Quartz device tab</A></H3>



<H3><A NAME="SEC33">Packages tab</A></H3>



<H3><A NAME="SEC34">Misc tab</A></H3>



<H2><A NAME="SEC35">The near future of the Aqua GUI</A></H2>
<P>
Jointly with Simon Urbanek we are currently working to replace the current Aqua GUI, which is Carbon-based,
with a pure Cocoa GUI. This will allow for a better integration of R with Mac OS X and
a fully Aqua-compliant GUI.
A preview of the Cocoa GUI for Darwin R can be obtained after the official
release of R 1.9.0 is out from <A HREF="http://www.economia.unimi.it/R">http://www.economia.unimi.it/R</A>.


<H2><A NAME="SEC36">Aqua GUI Bugs</A></H2>
<P>
On Unix systems a bug report can be generated using the function
<CODE>bug.report()</CODE>.  This automatically includes the version
information and sends the bug to the correct address.  Alternatively the
bug report can be emailed to <A HREF="mailto:R-bugs@R-project.org">R-bugs@R-project.org</A> or submitted
to the Web page at <A HREF="http://bugs.R-project.org/">http://bugs.R-project.org/</A>.


<P>
You can also send specific Aqua GUI bugs directly to <A HREF="mailto:stefano.iacus@unimi.it">stefano.iacus@unimi.it</A>


<P>
In any circumstances, in case of a crash, please report the 
crash.log for the <EM>R.bin</EM> application. You can get this
crash.log using the <EM>Console.app</EM> located inside <EM>/Applications/Utilities</EM>.




<H1><A NAME="SEC37">Quartz device</A></H1>



<H1><A NAME="SEC38">Additional resources</A></H1>
<P>
Here are few references that can be of interest for Mac OS X and/or developers.




<H2><A NAME="SEC39">Apple Developer Connection</A></H2>
<P>
The Apple Developer Connection (can be reached at <A HREF="http://developer.apple.com">http://developer.apple.com</A>) is the main source
of information for Apple products (OS, hardware, software) for developers. You can subscribe for free to
ADC and get the latest up-to-date tools from Apple (compilers for example).




<H2><A NAME="SEC40">The R for Mac OS X Developer page</A></H2>
<P>
There is a page dedicated to the latest R-devel version of R. This page is located at
<A HREF="http://www.economia.unimi.it/R">http://www.economia.unimi.it/R</A> and is mantained by Stefano M. Iacus.
This page is inteded to give additional documentation for building  the latest R-devel
version of R. From time to time, snapshots of R-devel binaries are available for testing purposes.




<H1><A NAME="SEC41">Acknowledgments</A></H1>

<P>
Special thanks go to Simon Urbanek, Jan de Leeuw, Byron Ellis and Thomas Lumley
in random order. Last but not least Apple for amazing OS and GUI.
