<h2 class="chapter">Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a very first try of writing a R for Mac OS X. I hope to finish it in time for R-1.9.0. 
In any case, please send me requests/questions you would like answers on.

   <p>This document contains information on how to build <small>R</small> from sources, how to install and run it. 
It also contains a user guide to the Aqua GUI version of <small>R</small>.

<h3 class="section">How many versions of R for Mac OS X?</h3>

<p>There is currently only one version of R for Mac OS X. 
But R on Mac OS X can be used as a command-line application (see <a href="#Command%20line%20version%20of%20R">Command line version of R</a>), like on any
other unix-like system, or via the Aqua GUI (see <a href="#R%20with%20Aqua%20GUI">R with Aqua GUI</a>). This second approach in using R
for Mac OS X is mostly preferred by "traditional" Macintosh users.

<h3 class="section">What machines does R for Mac OS X run on?</h3>

<p>R for Mac OS X requires Mac OS X version 10.2 or higher to run. The latest version of the system is
always preferable though. We do not support Mac OS X version 10.1.

<h3 class="subsection">the C/C++ compiler gcc 3.3</h4>

<p>If you have Mac OS X 10.3 (aka Panther) you just need to install the software inside the Xcode Tools CD
(which is CD number 4). This is only true if you bought Panther. In most of the cases you have
Panther already installed on your brand new machine, which means that you don't have the forth
Developer CD. You should take it from Apple Developer Connection site (see <a href="#Apple%20Developer%20Connection">Apple Developer Connection</a>): in the
download section, look for Xcode Tools v 1.1 or above.

   <p>If you are using Mac OS X 10.2 (aka Jaguar) then you should download and install the
Apple Developers Tools Dec 2002 including the latest updates which dates August 2003. Either it comes
on a separate CD with your Mac, either you can download these  from the Apple Developer Connection site (see <a href="#Apple%20Developer%20Connection">Apple Developer Connection</a>)
In either cases be sure you have gcc version 3.3 just by typing in a Terminal window
<pre class="example">     gcc -vv
     </pre>

<h3 class="subsection">the Fortran compiler g77 for gcc 3.3</h4>

<p>You need to install a version of the g77 Fortran compiler which is built for gcc 3.3. 
The following instructions apply to binaries coming from  HPC for Mac OS X page <a href="http://hpc.sourceforge.net">http://hpc.sourceforge.net</a>. 
Please take care: there are two versions of the g77 binaries, one for Jaguar and one for Panther. 
Use the appropriate one.

   <p>Once you have the binaries, please do the following (you'll be asked for a root password):
cd to the download folder and type
<pre class="example">     sudo tar -zxvf g77v3.4-bin.tar.gz -C /
     rehash
     </pre>
   It installs everything in <em>/usr/local</em>. The name of the .tar.gz archive can be different, see the related web page.

</div>

<h3 class="subsection">the libreadline 4.3 (optional)</h4>

<p>This library is optional. 
You need this library to be able to retrive history using use arrow keys or for tab completion of filenames
when you run R as a command line tool. The original source archive is located at GNU Org web page <a href="ftp://www.gnu.org">ftp://www.gnu.org</a>. 
You need to modify the original file <em>shlib/Makefile.in</em> in order to make it
work under MacOS X 10.2.x and later (this is because libreadline needs to be linked against
<em>-lncurses -lcc_dynamic</em>). If you can do better at configure time working on the original archive
let me know. I suggest you to download my patched version from <a href="http://www.economia.unimi.it/R">http://www.economia.unimi.it/R</a>. 
Once you have done, please do the following (you'll be asked for a root password):
uncompress the archive, cd inside the folder and type the following
<pre class="example">     ./configure
     make
     sudo make install
     </pre>
   It installs everything in <em>/usr/local</em>. 
These instructions apply to both Jaguar and Panther.

<h3 class="subsection">the X11 window server (optional)</h4>

<p>If you have Panther, you probably have the X11 Window server already installed on your system. 
This is what you need to run a version of R with the capability of using the X11 device, but it isn't sufficient
if you want to build it. 
You need to install the additional X11 SDK package from the Xcode Tools CD. 
Please note: the installer on the Xcode Tools CD does not install the X11 SDK by default:
you should look inside the Xcode Tools CD and install manually the X11 SDK.

   <p>If you have Jaguar, you'll need to install both the X11 Window server and the X11 SDK package from
the XFree86 web page.  Apple site only supports the latest version of his OS (at the moment Panther). 
Users report that other version of X11 Window Servers (other than the one distributed by Apple) work as well.

<h3 class="subsection">the TclTk 8.4 headers and libraries (optional)</h4>

<p>You need to download the sources of the Tcl and Tk 8.4.x packages to build yourself the sources. 
The original sources can be found on the official TclTk web page <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/8.4.html">http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/8.4.html</a>. 
Please do the following respecting the sequence (you'll be asked for a root password). These are examples for version 8.4.4
of the Tcl and Tk sources, you'll probably find new version on the web page, thus only the name of the .tar.gz archives
changes.

   <p>For Tcl: download the tlc 8.4 sources, cd inside the folder where you have downloaded the archive and
type:
<pre class="example">     tar zxf tcl8.4.4-src.tar.gz
     cd tcl8.4.4/unix/
     ./configure
     make
     sudo make install
     </pre>

   <p>For Tk: download the tk 8.4 sources, cd inside the folder where you have downloaded the archive and type:
<pre class="example">     tar zxf tk8.4.4-src.tar.gz
     cd tk8.4.4/unix/

<h3 class="section">How to configure and build R</h3>

<p>Download the latest sources of R from <small>CRAN</small>. Unpack the archive with tar -zxf <em>name_of_R_sources_archive</em> and cd
inside the R sources directory. Then you need to configure R for your system and build R. 
Just type
<pre class="example">     ./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack --with-aqua
     make
     </pre>
   This will configure R to be built as a Framework to be installed inside your <em>/Library/Frameworks</em> directory with the name
<em>R.framework</em>. You can change the default location of the <em>R.framework</em>
installation at configure time by specifying the flag <em>-enable-R-framework[=DIR]</em>, i.e. 
with something like
<pre class="example">     ./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack
                 --with-aqua --enable-R-framework=FOO
     </pre>
   and the final destination of the <em>R.framework</em> will be <em>FOO/R.framework</em>, which means that you
don't have to specify the <em>R.framework</em> text in the path.

<p>A standard installation of R requires you have built it as a Framework. At this point just type (a root
password will be required):
<pre class="example">     sudo make install
     </pre>
   and all will be installed in <em>/Library/Frameworks</em>. 
You can decide to change the R.framework destination by using the <em>prefix</em> option specifying the
final destination.
<pre class="smallexample">     sudo make prefix=/where/you/want/R.framework/to/go install
     </pre>
   As in the above, you don't need to specify the name <em>R.framework</em> in the path.

<p>At the moment, there is nothing special to  do to build the Aqua GUI. 
You just need to install it using

     </pre>
   and it will install the <em>R.app</em> application in the <em>Applications</em> folder on your system. 
The install procedure fails if the <code>R.framework</code> has not been installed first.

<h2 class="chapter">Command line version of R</h2>

<p>The command line version of <small>R</small> is nothing but a classic unix-like implementation of <small>R</small>. So general
documentation for <small>R</small> applies to this version as well. 
On each release (and patched-release) ready to use binaries are distributed through <small>CRAN</small>. 
These binaries come with a common installer used by R with Aqua GUI so please read
the releated notes (see <a href="#How%20to%20get%20R%20with%20Aqua%20GUI">How to get R with Aqua GUI</a>). 
To use <small>R</small> you probably need to add a symbolic link on your System as the <small>R</small> binary is
located inside the framework. 
Suppose you have the <em>/usr/local/bin</em> directory on your System, than you should just
type in your Terminal (a root password is required)
<pre class="smallexample">     sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R /usr/local/bin/R
     </pre>
   Assuming that you have <em>/usr/local/bin</em> in your <em>PATH</em> environment variable, you'll be able to launch R from any location
on your System just by typing <em>R</em>. 
In this way, when you install a new version of the <em>R.framework</em> this link will point to the latest R binary.

<h3 class="section">How to get R with Aqua GUI</h3>

<p>The <code>bin/macosx</code> directory of a <small>CRAN</small> site contains a standard
Apple installer package named <code>R.dmg.sit</code> compressed in Aladdin
Stuffit format.  Once downloaded, uncompressed and executed, the
installer will install the current non-developer release of R.  R  is
a native Mac OS X Darwin version of R with an Aqua GUI. 
Inside
<code>bin/macosx/</code><var>x</var><code>.</code><var>y</var><code></code> there are prebuilt binary packages to
be used with R corresponding to the "<var>x</var>.<var>y</var>" release of
R. The installation of these packages is available through the
"Package" menu of the Aqua GUI (see <a href="#Packages%20Menu">Packages Menu</a>).

<p>In this section you'll find general informations on the Aqua GUI. For specific <small>R</small> tasks that
can be done via the Aqua GUI using menus you should read below (see <a href="#The%20Menus">The Menus</a>).

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">The Input and the Output</h4>

<p>The current desing of the R Console is to have separate frames for input (user) and output (R). 
The user is supposed to type command into the bottom frame of the R Console, this input is echoed
into the upper frame and R will give any related output in the upper frame. 
The output frame (the upper one) is a read-only frame.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Copy and Paste</h4>

<p>Copy and paste works in R as in any other Macintosh application. 
But when two selection are active: one in the output frame and one in the input frame, the output frame takes precedence
when copying to the clipboard. 
You can also copy from the <em>quartz()</em> graphic device (see <a href="#Quartz%20device">Quartz device</a>) to the clipboard. In this case a bitmap image is
created. If you want high resolution graphic exports, you should better save the image using the <em>File/Save as</em> menu item (see <a href="#Quartz%20device">Quartz device</a>).

</div>

<h3 class="subsection">The current and startup working directories</h4>

<p>If not otherwise specified in the Preferences (see <a href="#Preferences">Preferences</a>), or if the specified path is no longer available, then
the default working directory at startup is the user home. 
The working directory can be changed using the <em>setwd</em> R command or using the <em>Tools</em> menut item <em>Change working directory</em>. 
The current working directory is displayed on the main bar of the R Console window.

<p>This feature is useful if you want different startup procedures defined by the <code>.Rprofile</code>; you can
edit a <code>.Rprofile</code> (contaning you personale initialization <small>R</small> commands) in a particular directory and use
the Preferences to change the startup directory. Next time you launch <code>R.app</code> the <code>.Rprofile</code> is readed and executed
by <small>R</small> at startup. This is the equivalent on Unix (or the command line) to launch <small>R</small> from different directories.

<h3 class="subsection">Resizing the R Console</h4>

<p>When the R Console Window is resized, the R option <em>width</em> is set appropriately so that any future
output will fit the window size. This behaviour can be inihibited using the Preferences settings (see <a href="#Preferences">Preferences</a>). 
On closing the R application, the position and the size of the R Console window are saved in the Preferences and reused
next time you launch R. You can inihibit R to do this using the appropriate Preferences settings.

<p>The Application menu is the first one after the main Apple Menu. In Mac OS X 10.3 it reports the name R.bin under Mac OS X 10.2 it is just R (as it should be). 
We are not able to fix this behaviour at the moment.

   <p>With this menu you can access three items: 1. the About box, which tells you which version of R is currently in use, 2. Check for updates, which search on <small>CRAN</small> if a new version
of the binary distribution of <small>R</small> for Mac OS X is available (you need an internet connection), 3. you can access the Preferences (see <a href="#Preferences">Preferences</a>).

<p>Jointly with Simon Urbanek we are currently working to replace the current Aqua GUI, which is Carbon-based,
with a pure Cocoa GUI. This will allow for a better integration of R with Mac OS X and
a fully Aqua-compliant GUI. 
A preview of the Cocoa GUI for Darwin R can be obtained after the official
release of R 1.9.0 is out from <a href="http://www.economia.unimi.it/R">http://www.economia.unimi.it/R</a>.

<p>At the moment the GUI menus only provide direct access/download/installation of packages located on <small>CRAN</small> or in the
Bioconductor repository. You can also install packages from local files, either binary of source packages, as explained
below. Otherwise you can use the appropriate <small>R</small> commands to install packages from a specific location other than the above mentioned ones.

<h3 class="section">Installation of packages from source</h3>

<p>You can choose to install packages from source if they are located on <small>CRAN</small>, on the BioConductor repository and
on your local disk. In any case, in order to be able to build packages from source, you need to have the same working
setup for building <small>R</small> itself (see <a href="#Building%20R%20from%20sources">Building R from sources</a>). In same cases you can still build packages without all
the tools installed, but surely not for all the packages contaning C/C++ or Fortran source code.

<p>If you decide to install packages from <small>CRAN</small> you should use the <em>Packages</em> menu of the GUI. In particular the subitem <em>Get CRAN packages.../Source</em>. 
This will connect to <small>CRAN</small> through the Internet and a list of available packages will be shown. 
This is list tells you if a package is already installed on your system, the version of the package available on <small>CRAN</small> and the version
of the same package if already installed. 
You can make multiple selection of packages you intend to install using the checkboxes (one per package). 
When you close this window, you'll be asked if you really want to download the selected packages and the process of installation
begins. If you don't select any package, nothing happens. 
<small>R</small> will not respond on the Console until you  close this window. 
The same applies for packages in the BioConductor repository. You have also several other options specific to the
BioConductor way of managing repositories of packages.

<p>You can also download any other package from the Internet yourself and decide to install it from source. 
You have to use <em>Packages/-&gt;Install form local file</em> submenus. Where you can choose a standard <code>package.tar.gz</code>
tarball or the directory containing your package if you have the package in expanded form.

<h3 class="section">Installation of pre-built binary packages</h3>

<p>Same considerations of above apply with two minor differences. The first one is that se only distribute pre-built
version of packages which pass all the test/checks on Mac OS X. So you'll see that some of the packages are missing with respect to the huge list
of source packages available on <small>CRAN</small>.

<p>The second difference is that, when you install packages from local file, it is assumed that the binary package is named
as <code>package.tgz</code>. This is to distinguish among source and binary archives.

<h3 class="section">Can I install packages built for other platforms?</h3>

<p>As a general rule the answer is <em>yes</em> if the package does not contain any C/C++/Fortran code in the sources, otherwise
the answer is negative. Another caution should be taken, that is, the package and the installed version of <small>R</small> should be
the same major release, i.e. you can install a package built for <small>R</small> 1.8.0 on <small>R</small> 1.8.1, but usually not the same
package on <small>R</small> 1.9.0.

<p>A Mac OS X specific requirements, is that a prebuilt package is assumed to be named (and accordingly archived and
compressed) as <code>package_name.tgz</code>. 
On Windows, for example, packages come in a zipped format.

<p>The main library of packages is the one located inside the R.framework. This library contains the packages (base and
reccomended ones) distributed along with <small>R</small>. At the moment you cannot use the GUI Console to install packages
in this location because of authentication problems, you can surely do this from the command line with an admin
password, with something like
<pre class="example">     sudo R CMD INSTALL pkg_ver.tar.gz
     </pre>

<p>By default, the user of <code>R.app</code> installs packages inside the <code>Library/R/library</code> directory
in his home directory, i.e. <code>~/Library/R/library</code>. 
If you install a package using the <code>R.app</code> interfaces and you then use <small>R</small> from the command line,
you won't see or have access to these packages unless you add the <code>~/Library/R/library</code> to the
list of libraries locations. You can do the following from inside <small>R</small>
<pre class="example">     .libPaths("~/Library/R/library")
     </pre>
   or write this command in the <code>.Rprofile</code> file in your startup directory. 
On some version of OS X the <code>~</code> symbol is not correctly expanded. You should preferably use this
version of the above command
<pre class="example">     .libPaths(path.expand("~/Library/R/library"))
     </pre>

<p>If you have a version of <code>RAqua.app</code> installed on your system, it is likely that you have all the
packages installed in <code>~/Library/RAqua/library</code>. You can add this library of packages in the <code>.libPaths()</code>
but most of them will probably not work as they were built for release 1.8.x of <small>R</small>.

<h3 class="section">Apple Script support</h3>

<p><small>R</small> has partial support for AppleScripts. 
At the moment R can be invoked and asked to run commands from an AppleScript script. 
What follows is an example of script that interacts with <small>R</small>. It firstly  invokes <small>R</small> and then
sends commands to <small>R</small> with the <code>cmd</code> applescript command.

<pre class="example">     set CommandLine to "R.Version()"
     try
     	tell application "R"
     		activate
     		with timeout of 90000 seconds
     			cmd CommandLine
     			cmd "Sys.getenv()"
     			cmd "print(\"HelloWorld!\")"
     		end timeout
     	end tell
     end try
     </pre>

<p>In the above, <code>cmd</code> is the (only) applescript command in the <small>R</small> dictionary that is
used to tell <small>R</small> to execute an <small>R</small> command in the R Console. The syntax is
<pre class="example">     cmd &lt;command string&gt;
     </pre>
   where command string have to be in quotes. Actually, the output of the command
is not sent back to the application that is calling <small>R</small> but to the <small>R</small> Console directly.

<p>There are some issues. The first is that if <small>R</small> is still not running, it will take a while (depending on
how fast your machine is) to startup. In the meanwhile the script sends commands without waiting and it
could happen that some commands are missed by <small>R</small>, i.e. they arrive before <small>R</small> is ready to
receive applescript commands. The second issue, is that it could be that the applescript calls a bad version
of <small>R</small>. This could happen if you have an old version of <small>R</small> (for example the old Carbon <small>R</small>) installed on your
System.

<p>As an example, we report here a small script that asks <small>R</small> to <code>source</code> a file using a file dialog.
<pre class="smallexample">     set file_to_source to (choose file with prompt "Choose file to source") as alias
     
     try
     	tell application "R"
     		activate
     		with timeout of 90000 seconds
     			cmd "source(\"" &amp; file_to_source &amp; "\")"
     		end timeout
     	end tell
     end try
     </pre>

<h3 class="section">External editors</h3>

<p><small>R</small> accepts the Apple Event command <em>open</em>. This means than an external editor can communicate with <small>R</small> sending
portions of <small>R</small> code to execute via files. This is the approach used by the <small>R</small>-Tcl Mode in Alpha X
(see <a href="http://www.kelehers.org/alpha/">http://www.kelehers.org/alpha/</a>).

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Finder actions</h3>

<p>Dragging a file on the <small>R</small> icon, causes <small>R</small> to source this file via the <code>source</code> <small>R</small> command or,
if the file is an <small>R</small> image data file RDX1 or RDX2 (normally files with extension <code>.rda</code> or <code>.Rdata</code>), the data is loaded in the workspace and every object
with the same name in the workspace is overwritten wihtout notice. Loading a data file is equivalent to
the <small>R</small> command <code>load</code>. 
At the moment there is no control over the file types, i.e. dragging wrong files (i.e. files that are
not <small>R</small> scripts or image data) simply gives an error. It's up to the user to <em>do the right thing</em>.

<p>If <small>R</small> is not yet running this action causes <small>R</small> to startup.

<h2 class="chapter">Quartz device</h2>

<p>The quartz device is the native graphic device in R for Mac OS X. It's name derives from Apple's Quartz Tecnology
which is essentially similar to PDF rendering. One of the most amazing features of Quartz is antialising which gives you
<em>very nice</em> plots and images. Try to compare  a quartz plot  with the same plot generated on
any other interactive device. For its PDF nature it is also resolution independent.

<h3 class="section">Interactive mode</h3>

<p>The quartz device allows for interaction. You can use both <code>identify</code> and <code>locator</code> functions. 
To break the sequence you should press the ESC key on your keyboard as Apple's mouse have ever had only one
button.

<h3 class="section">Saving the image</h3>

<p>You can can the content of the quartz device window into a PDF file. This is a very simple way to
export high quality graphics from <small>R</small> into other applications on Mac OS X graphics is PDF based (so are almost all
applications available). If you want bitmap copies of you quartz device window just use copy, to copy the image into the clipboard and
paste the result in a graphic application (see <a href="#Copying%20the%20image%20into%20the%20clipboard">Copying the image into the clipboard</a>).

<h3 class="section">Copying the image into the clipboard</h3>

<p>You can copy the content of the quartz device window in the clipboard to make the resulting image available for
pasting into other applications. The clipboard will contain a bitmap copy of the quartz device window. If you
want to work with high resolution images, you should save the content of the quartz device as a PDF file (see <a href="#Saving%20the%20image">Saving the image</a>). 
Pay attention to the following fact: the bitmap image produced has exactly the same dimensions of the quartz device window. This
means that if you resize the window, the resulting image you obtain in the clipboard will have the same
dimensions and you cannot resize the image from the inside another applications (say MS-Word) without loosing quality.
