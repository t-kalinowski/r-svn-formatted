This is a very first try of writing a R for Mac OS X. I hope to finish it in time for R-1.9.0.
In any case, please send me requests/questions you would like answers on.

This document contains information on how to build @R{} from sources, how to install and run it.
It also contains a user guide to the Aqua GUI version of @R{}.

@section How many versions of R for Mac OS X?

There is currently only one version of R for Mac OS X.
But R on Mac OS X can be used as a command-line application (@pxref{Command line version of R}), like on any
other unix-like system, or via the Aqua GUI (@pxref{R with Aqua GUI}). This second approach in using R
for Mac OS X is mostly preferred by "traditional" Macintosh users.

@node What machines does R for Mac OS X run on?, How can R for Mac OS X be obtained and installed?, How many versions of R for Mac OS X?, Introduction
@section What machines does R for Mac OS X run on?

R for Mac OS X requires Mac OS X version 10.2 or higher to run. The latest version of the system is
always preferable though. We do not support Mac OS X version 10.1.

@node the C/C++ compiler gcc 3.3
@subsection the C/C++ compiler gcc 3.3
If you have Mac OS X 10.3 (aka Panther) you just need to install the software inside the Xcode Tools CD 
(which is CD number 4). This is only true if you bought Panther. In most of the cases you have 
Panther already installed on your brand new machine, which means that you don't have the forth 
Developer CD. You should take it from Apple Developer Connection site (@pxref{Apple Developer Connection}): in the
download section, look for Xcode Tools v 1.1 or above.

If you are using Mac OS X 10.2 (aka Jaguar) then you should download and install the 
Apple Developers Tools Dec 2002 including the latest updates which dates August 2003. Either it comes 
on a separate CD with your Mac, either you can download these  from the Apple Developer Connection site (@pxref{Apple Developer Connection})
In either cases be sure you have gcc version 3.3 just by typing in a Terminal window 
@example
gcc -vv
@end example

@node the Fortran compiler g77 for gcc 3.3
@subsection the Fortran compiler g77 for gcc 3.3
You need to install a version of the g77 Fortran compiler which is built for gcc 3.3. 
The following instructions apply to binaries coming from  HPC for Mac OS X page @uref{http://hpc.sourceforge.net}. 
Please take care: there are two versions of the g77 binaries, one for Jaguar and one for Panther. 
Use the appropriate one.

Once you have the binaries, please do the following (you'll be asked for a root password):
cd to the download folder and type
@example
sudo tar -zxvf g77v3.4-bin.tar.gz -C /
rehash
@end example
It installs everything in @emph{/usr/local}. The name of the .tar.gz archive can be different, see the related web page.


@node the libreadline 4.3 (optional)
@subsection the libreadline 4.3 (optional)
This library is optional. 
You need this library to be able to retrive history using use arrow keys or for tab completion of filenames
when you run R as a command line tool. The original source archive is located at GNU Org web page @uref{ftp://www.gnu.org}. 
You need to modify the original file @emph{shlib/Makefile.in} in order to make it
work under MacOS X 10.2.x and later (this is because libreadline needs to be linked against
@emph{-lncurses -lcc_dynamic}). If you can do better at configure time working on the original archive 
let me know. I suggest you to download my patched version from @uref{http://www.economia.unimi.it/R}. 
Once you have done, please do the following (you'll be asked for a root password):
uncompress the archive, cd inside the folder and type the following
@example
./configure
make
sudo make install
@end example
It installs everything in @emph{/usr/local}.
These instructions apply to both Jaguar and Panther.

@node the X11 window server (optional)
@subsection the X11 window server (optional)
If you have Panther, you probably have the X11 Window server already installed on your system. 
This is what you need to run a version of R with the capability of using the X11 device, but it isn't sufficient
if you want to build it.
You need to install the additional X11 SDK package from the Xcode Tools CD. 
Please note: the installer on the Xcode Tools CD does not install the X11 SDK by default: 
you should look inside the Xcode Tools CD and install manually the X11 SDK.

If you have Jaguar, you'll need to install both the X11 Window server and the X11 SDK package from 
the XFree86 web page.  Apple site only supports the latest version of his OS (at the moment Panther).
Users report that other version of X11 Window Servers (other than the one distributed by Apple) work as well.

@node the TclTk 8.4 headers and libraries (optional)
@subsection the TclTk 8.4 headers and libraries (optional)
You need to download the sources of the Tcl and Tk 8.4.x packages to build yourself the sources. 
The original sources can be found on the official TclTk web page @uref{http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/8.4.html}.
Please do the following respecting the sequence (you'll be asked for a root password). These are examples for version 8.4.4
of the Tcl and Tk sources, you'll probably find new version on the web page, thus only the name of the .tar.gz archives
changes.


For Tcl: download the tlc 8.4 sources, cd inside the folder where you have downloaded the archive and
type:
@example
tar zxf tcl8.4.4-src.tar.gz
cd tcl8.4.4/unix/
./configure
make
sudo make install
@end example

For Tk: download the tk 8.4 sources, cd inside the folder where you have downloaded the archive and type:
@example
tar zxf tk8.4.4-src.tar.gz
cd tk8.4.4/unix/
./configure
make
sudo make install
@end example

@node a TeX suite of tools for documentation (optional)
@subsection a TeX suite of tools for documentation (optional)
There is a nice installer, called the i-installer II, that allows you to install a complete 
teTeX distribution. You can find details on the i-installer at @uref{http://www.rna.nl/ii.html}. 
The teTeX is one of the i-Packages.

@node How to configure and build R, How to install R, What is needed to build R, Building R from sources  
@section How to configure and build R
Download the latest sources of R from @CRAN{}. Unpack the archive with tar -zxf @emph{name_of_R_sources_archive} and cd
inside the R sources directory. Then you need to configure R for your system and build R. 
Just type
@example
./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack --with-aqua 
make
@end example
This will configure R to be built as a Framework to be installed inside your @emph{/Library/Frameworks} directory with the name 
@emph{R.framework}. You can change the default location of the @emph{R.framework} 
installation at configure time by specifying the flag @emph{--enable-R-framework[=DIR]}, i.e. 
with something like
@example
./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack 
            --with-aqua --enable-R-framework=FOO
@end example
and the final destination of the @emph{R.framework} will be @emph{FOO/R.framework}, which means that you 
don't have to specify the @emph{R.framework} text in the path. 

@node How to install R, How to build and install the Aqua GUI, How to configure and build R, Building R from sources
@section How to install R
A standard installation of R requires you have built it as a Framework. At this point just type (a root 
password will be required):
@example
sudo make install
@end example
and all will be installed in @emph{/Library/Frameworks}.
You can decide to change the R.framework destination by using the @emph{--prefix} option specifying the final destination.
As in the above, you don't need to specify the name @emph{R.framework} in the path.

@node  How to build and install the Aqua GUI,  ,How to install R, Building R from sources
@section How to build and install the Aqua GUI
At the moment, there is nothing special to  do to build the Aqua GUI.
You just need to install it using
@example
make install-aqua
@end example
and it will install the @emph{R.app} application in the @emph{Applications} folder on your system.
The install procedure fails if the @file{R.framework} has not been installed first.


@node Command line version of R, R with Aqua GUI, Building R from sources, Top
@chapter Command line version of R
The command line version of @R{} is nothing but a classic unix-like implementation of @R{}. So general 
documentation for @R{} applies to this version as well.
On each release (and patched-release) ready to use binaries are distributed through @CRAN{}.
These binaries come with a common installer used by R with Aqua GUI so please read
the releated notes (@pxref{How to get R with Aqua GUI}).
To use @R{} you probably need to add a symbolic link on your System as the @R{} binary is 
located inside the framework.
Suppose you have the @emph{/usr/local/bin} directory on your System, than you should just 
type in your Terminal (a root password is required)
@smallexample
sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R /usr/local/bin/R
@end smallexample
Assuming that you have @emph{/usr/local/bin} in your @emph{PATH} environment variable, you'll be able to launch R from any location
on your System just by typing @emph{R}.
In this way, when you install a new version of the @emph{R.framework} this link will point to the latest R binary.

The @file{bin/macosx} directory of a @CRAN{} site contains a standard
Apple installer package named @file{R.dmg.sit} compressed in Aladdin
Stuffit format.  Once downloaded, uncompressed and executed, the
installer will install the current non-developer release of R.  R  is
a native Mac OS X Darwin version of R with an Aqua GUI. 
Inside
@file{bin/macosx/@var{x}.@var{y}} there are prebuilt binary packages to
be used with R corresponding to the ``@var{x}.@var{y}'' release of
R. The installation of these packages is available through the
``Package'' menu of the Aqua GUI (@pxref{Packages Menu}).

In this section you'll find general informations on the Aqua GUI. For specific @R{} tasks that
can be done via the Aqua GUI using menus you should read below (@pxref{The Menus}).

@node The Input and the Output
@subsection The Input and the Output
The current desing of the R Console is to have separate frames for input (user) and output (R).
The user is supposed to type command into the bottom frame of the R Console, this input is echoed
into the upper frame and R will give any related output in the upper frame.
The output frame (the upper one) is a read-only frame. 

@node Copy and Paste
@subsection  Copy and Paste
Copy and paste works in R as in any other Macintosh application.
But when two selection are active: one in the output frame and one in the input frame, the output frame takes precedence 
when copying to the clipboard.
You can also copy from the @emph{quartz()} graphic device (@pxref{Quartz device}) to the clipboard. In this case a bitmap image is
created. If you want high resolution graphic exports, you should better save the image using the @emph{File/Save as} menu item (@pxref{Quartz device}).


@node The current and startup working directories
@subsection The current and startup working directories
If not otherwise specified in the Preferences (@pxref{Preferences}), or if the specified path is no longer available, then
the default working directory at startup is the user home.
The working directory can be changed using the @emph{setwd} R command or using the @emph{Tools} menut item @emph{Change working directory}.
The current working directory is displayed on the main bar of the R Console window.
 
@node Resizing the R Console
@subsection Resizing the R Console
When the R Console Window is resized, the R option @emph{width} is set appropriately so that any future
output will fit the window size. This behaviour can be inihibited using the Preferences settings (@pxref{Preferences}).
On closing the R application, the position and the size of the R Console window are saved in the Preferences and reused
next time you launch R. You can inihibit R to do this using the appropriate Preferences settings.

@node Input and Output text colors
@subsection Input and Output text colors
Text windows and frames are divided in Read-Only and Read and Write ones. Text colors can be set separately
for the two kinds of windows. This happens as well for their respectives backgrounds. Use the Preferences window to set these 
colors (@pxref{Preferences}).

@subsection Application Menu
The Application menu is the first one after the main Apple Menu. In Mac OS X 10.3 it reports the name R.bin under Mac OS X 10.2 it is just R (as it should be).
We are not able to fix this behaviour at the moment.

With this menu you can access three items: 1. the About box, which tells you which version of R is currently in use, 2. Check for updates, which search on @CRAN{} if a new version
of the binary distribution of @R{} for Mac OS X is available (you need an internet connection), 3. you can access the Preferences (@pxref{Preferences}). 

@node File Menu
@subsection File Menu
This menu provides standard functionalities. 
The @emph{open} command is associated to the action  @emph{Source @R{} code}, which means that you can select a file, which is a script, and it will be executed

@chapter Quartz device
The quartz device is the native graphic device in R for Mac OS X. It's name derives from Apple's Quartz Tecnology
which is essentially similar to PDF rendering. One of the most amazing features of Quartz is antialising which gives you
@emph{very nice} plots and images. Try to compare with a quartz plot done with any other interactive device.
It is also resolution independent.

@section Saving the image
You can can the content of the quartz device window into a PDF file. This is a very simple way to
export high quality graphics from @R{} into other applications on Mac OS X graphics is PDF based (so are almost all
applications available). If you want bitmap copies of you quartz device window just use copy, to copy the image into the clipboard and
paste the result in a graphic application (@pxref{Copying the image into the clipboard}).

@node Copying the image into the clipboard, Known bugs and missing features, Saving the image, Quartz device
@section Copying the image into the clipboard
You can copy the content of the quartz device window in the clipboard to make the resulting image available for
pasting into other applications. The clipboard will contain a bitmap copy of the quartz device window. If you
want to work with high resolution images, you should save the content of the quartz device as a PDF file (@pxref{Saving the image}).
Pay attention to the following fact: the bitmap image produced has exactly the same dimensions of the quartz device window. This
means that if you resize the window, the resulting image you obtain in the clipboard will have the same
dimensions and you cannot resize the image from the inside another applications (say MS-Word) without loosing quality.
