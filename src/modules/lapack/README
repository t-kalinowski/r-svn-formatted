The Fortran routines here are extracted from LAPACK 3.0
(http://www.netlib.org/lapack and mirrors).

double.f are support routines for `real' LAPACK calls
cmplx.f are support routines for LAPACK calls from complex arithmetic
routines, that are only used if COMPLEX*16 is supported by the Fortran
compiler and compatible with the Rcomplex type (guaranteed for f2c users).
They will not be compiled if an external LAPACK is used.

blas2.f contains additional (to src/appl/blas.f) BLAS routines needed
by double.f.

cmplxblas.f contains BLAS routines needed by cmplx.f.

blas2.f and cmplxblas.f are not used if a full BLAS implementation is
found at configure time.

rgeev.f had to be corrected (lines 180-1) to allow LWORK queries to run.
It calls dlange, which is missing in SunPerf, so a copy of that is
included.
