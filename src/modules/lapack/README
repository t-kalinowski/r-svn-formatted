The Fortran routines here are extracted from LAPACK 3.0
(http://www.netlib.org/lapack and mirrors).

dlapack?.f are support routines for `real' LAPACK calls
cmplx.f are support routines for LAPACK calls from complex arithmetic
routines, that are only used if COMPLEX*16 is supported by the Fortran
compiler and compatible with the Rcomplex type (guaranteed for f2c users).
Neither will not be compiled if an external LAPACK is used.

cmplxblas.f contains the double complex BLAS routines: it is not used
if a full BLAS implementation is found at configure time.
