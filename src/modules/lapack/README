The Fortran routines here are extracted from LAPACK 3.0
(http://www.netlib.org/lapack and mirrors).

dlapack?.f are support routines for `real' LAPACK calls
cmplx.f are support routines for LAPACK calls from complex arithmetic
routines, that are only used if COMPLEX*16 is supported by the Fortran
compiler and compatible with the Rcomplex type (guaranteed for f2c users).
Neither will not be compiled if an external LAPACK is used.

cmplxblas.f contains BLAS routines needed by cmplx.f: it is not used
if a full BLAS implementation is found at configure time.

rgeev.f is a corrected (lines 180-1) version of dgeev.f, to allow
LWORK queries to run.  (Late versions of dgeev.f are corrected.)  It
calls DLANGE, which was missing in libsunperf, so a renamed copy of
that is included.  Similarly, a renamed copy of LSAME is included as
that is not exported by MacOS's vecLib.

The routines dsyev and dsyevr have their names remapped to r* unless
HAVE_LAPACK is defined.  This ensures that the versions in rsyev.f
are called even if an external BLAS library contains LAPACK.  This was
necessary on 64-bit Solaris where the routines in libsunperf were
picked up and used excessive amounts of memory.  In principle it might
be necessary to extend this remapping to the other symbols used from
LAPACK.
