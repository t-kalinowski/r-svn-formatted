The Fortran routines here are extracted from LAPACK 3.0
(http://www.netlib.org/lapack and mirrors).

double.f are support routines for `real' LAPACK calls
cmplx.f are support routines for LAPACK calls from complex arithmetic
routines, that are only used if COMPLEX*16 is supported by the Fortran
compiler and compatible with the Rcomplex type (guaranteed for f2c users).
They will not be compiled if an external LAPACK is used.

cmplxblas.f contains BLAS routines needed by cmplx.f: it is not used
if a full BLAS implementation is found at configure time.

rgeev.f had to be corrected (lines 180-1) to allow LWORK queries to run.
It calls dlange, which is missing in SunPerf, so a copy of that is
included.
