 *	Evaluates the "deviance part"
 *	bd0(x,M) :=  M * D0(x/M) = M*[ x/M * log(x/M) + 1 - (x/M) ] =
 *		  =  x * log(x/M) + M - x
 *	where M = E[X] = n*p (or = lambda), for	  x, M > 0
 *
 *	in a manner that should be stable (with small relative error)
 *	for all x and np. In particular for x/np close to 1, direct
 *	evaluation fails, and evaluation is based on the Taylor series
 *	of log((1+v)/(1-v)) with v = (x-np)/(x+np).
