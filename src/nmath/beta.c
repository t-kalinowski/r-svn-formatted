 *  SYNOPSIS
 *
 *    #include "Mathlib.h"
 *    double beta(double a, double b);
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *    This function returns the value of the beta function
 *    evaluated with arguments a and b.
 *
 *  NOTES
 *
 *    This routine is a translation into C of a Fortran subroutine
 *    by W. Fullerton of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.
 *    Some modifications have been made so that the routines
 *    conform to the IEEE 754 standard.
