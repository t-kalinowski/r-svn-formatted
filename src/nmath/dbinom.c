 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *   To compute the binomial probability, call dbinom(x,n,p).
 *   This checks for argument validity, and calls dbinom_raw().
 *
 *   dbinom_raw() does the actual computation; note this is called by
 *   other functions in addition to dbinom()).
 *     (1) dbinom_raw() has both p and q arguments, when one may be represented
 *         more accurately than the other (in particular, in df()).
 *     (2) dbinom_raw() does NOT check that inputs x and n are integers. This
 *         should be done in the calling function, where necessary.
 *     (3) Also does not check for 0 <= p <= 1 and 0 <= q <= 1 or NaN's.
 *         Do this in the calling function.
