 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *   Gamma density,
 *                    lb^r x^{r-1} exp(-lb*x)
 *        p(x;r,lb) = -----------------------
 *                            (r-1)!
 *
 *   If USE_SCALE is defined below, the lb argument will be interpreted
 *   as a scale parameter (i.e. replace lb by 1/lb above).
 *   Otherwise, it is interpreted as a rate parameter, as above.
