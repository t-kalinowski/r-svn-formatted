 *  SYNOPSIS
 *
 *    #include "Mathlib.h"
 *    double dnbeta(double x, double a, double b, double lambda);
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *    Computes the density of the noncentral beta distribution with
 *    noncentrality parameter lambda.  The noncentral beta distribution
 *    has density:
 *
 *                     Inf
 *        f(x|a,b,d) = SUM p(i) * B(a+i,b) * x^(a+i-1) * (1-x)^(b-1)
 *                     i=0
 *
 *    where:
 *
 *              p(k) = exp(-lambda) lambda^k / k!
 *
 *            B(a,b) = Gamma(a+b) / (Gamma(a) * Gamma(b))
 *
 *
 *    This can be computed efficiently by using the recursions:
 *
 *            p(k+1) = (lambda/(k+1)) * p(k-1)
 *
 *        B(a+k+1,b) = ((a+b+k)/(a+k)) * B(a+k,b)
 *
 *    The summation of the series continues until
 *
 *              psum = p(0) + ... + p(k)
 *
 *    is close to 1.  Here we continue until 1 - psum < epsilon,
 *    with epsilon set close to the relative machine precision.
