 *  SYNOPSIS
 *
 *    #include <Rmath.h>
 *    double dnbeta(double x, double a, double b, double ncp, int give_log);
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *    Computes the density of the noncentral beta distribution with
 *    noncentrality parameter ncp.  The noncentral beta distribution
 *    has density:
 *
 *		       Inf
 *	f(x|a,b,ncp) = SUM  p(i) *  x^(a+i-1) * (1-x)^(b-1) / B(a+i,b)
 *		       i=0
 *
 *    where:
 *
 *		p(k) = exp(-ncp/2) (ncp/2)^k / k!
 *
 *	      B(a,b) = Gamma(a) * Gamma(b) / Gamma(a+b)
 *
 *
 *    This can be computed efficiently by using the recursions:
 *
 *	      p(k+1) = ncp/2 / (k+1) * p(k)
 *
 *      B(a+k+1,b)   = (a+k)/(a+b+k) * B(a+k,b)
 *
 *    The summation of the series continues until
 *
 *		psum = p(0) + ... + p(k)
 *
 *    is close to 1.  Here we continue until 1 - psum < epsilon,
 *    with epsilon set close to the relative machine precision.
