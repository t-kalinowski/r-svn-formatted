 * This code provides functions dbinom(x,n,p) and dpois(x,lb) for computing
 * binomial and Poisson probabilities, that attempt to be accurate for
 * a full range of parameter values (standard algorithms are often
 * inaccurate with large parameters).
 *

 *       into  ./dbinom.c, ./dpois.c and ./stirlerr.c
