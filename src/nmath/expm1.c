 *  SYNOPSIS
 *
 *	#include "Rmath.h"
 *	double expm1(double x);
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	Compute the Exponential minus 1
 *
 *			exp(x) - 1
 *
 *      accurately also when x is close to zero, i.e. |x| << 1
 *
 *  NOTES
 *
 *	As log1p(), this is a standard function in some C libraries,
 *	particularly GNU and BSD (but is neither ISO/ANSI C nor POSIX).
 *
 *  We supply a substitute for the case when there is no system one.
