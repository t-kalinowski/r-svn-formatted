 *    void gammalims(double *xmin, double *xmax);
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *    This function alculates the minimum and maximum legal bounds
 *    for x in gammafn(x).  These are not the only bounds, but they
 *    are the only non-trivial ones to calculate.
 *
 *  NOTES
 *
 *    This routine is a translation into C of a Fortran subroutine
 *    by W. Fullerton of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.
