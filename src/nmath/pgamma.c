 *  SYNOPSIS
 *
 *    #include "Mathlib.h"
 *    double pgamma(double x, double a, double scale);
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *    This function computes the distribution function for the
 *    gamma distribution with shape parameter a and scale parameter
 *    scale.  This is also known as the incomplete gamma function.
 *    See Abramowitz and Stegun (6.5.1) for example.
 *
 *  NOTES
 *
 *    This function is an adaptation of Algorithm 239 from the
 *    Applied Statistics Series.  The algorithm is faster than
 *    those by W. Fullerton in the FNLIB library and also the
 *    TOMS 542 alorithm of W. Gautschi.  It provides comparable
 *    accuracy to those algorithms and is considerably simpler.
