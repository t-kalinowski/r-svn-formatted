Making in this directory will make standalone libraries libRmath.a and
libRmath.so.  `make archive'  and `make shared'  make just one of them.

You may find you need GNU make, especially if builddir != srcdir.


To use the routines in your own C programs, include

#define MATHLIB_STANDALONE
#include "R_ext/Mathlib.h"


A little care is needed to use the random-number routines. You will
need to supply the uniform random number generator 

     double unif_rand(void)

or use the one supplied (and with a shared library you will have to
use the one supplied, which is the Marsaglia-multicarry with a call
set_seed to set its seed).

The facilties to change the normal random number generator are
available through the constant N01_kind. This takes values
from the enumeration type

typedef enum {
    KINDERMAN_RAMAGE,
    AHRENS_DIETER,
    BOX_MULLER
} N01type;

(and USER_NORM is not available).


There is full access to R's handling of NaNs, Inf and -Inf via special
versions of the macros and functions

    ISNAN, R_FINITE, R_log, R_pow and R_pow_di

and (extern) constants R_PosInf, R_NegInf and NA_REAL. These
facilities work best on IEEE 754 machines, but are available for all.

There is no support for R's notion of missing values, in particular
not for NA_INTEGER nor the distinction between NA and NaN for doubles.
