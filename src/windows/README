To create a version of R that can be compiled under windows (starting in Unix)
follow the following instructions:

	o make distclean in the R directory.

	o edit R/src/windows/Platform.h to indicate the version number 

	o run configure.win.

	o copy to the Windows machine the R/src directories: 
		- include
		- appl
		- graphics
		- main
		- math
		- regex
		- windows

	o copy the R directories:
		- afm 
		- demos
		- html
		- library


Then create a project in your favorite compiler/ide (mine's watcom these days)
	o this pretty much just consists of adding the C code to a project
	o the file engine.c in regex should NOT be included
	o you need to add the R/src/include;R/src/windows and R/src/regex
	  directories to the list of places to search for .h files
	o under Watcom you need to turn on case-sensitive linking (Windows
	  linking switches).
	
	o you need to add wincons.rc and wincons.rws to the project
	  and under Watcom you need to add /R/src/include to the includes
	  for the resource linker

Simply making the project at this point does the trick for me (most of the
time).
