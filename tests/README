In this directory,
various tests on R are made automatically.
This is the recommended way to check if R has been built successfully on
your architecture.

	make test-All
does both of
	make test-Examples
and	make test-Specific

the first of which runs all the examples from the help files (*.Rd) of all
core packages (base, eda, ..., ts) -- which can take quite long (5-15
minutes, depending on your environment).

The "fast" part of the tests is `test-Specific'
which runs the *.R files in this (./tests) directory (tolerantly) compares
the result *.Rout file with the prespecified *.Rout.save (if that exists).
