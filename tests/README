In this directory, various tests on R are run automatically.
This is the recommended way to check if R has been built successfully on
your architecture.

	make test-All
does both of
	make test-Examples
and	make test-Specific

the first of which runs all the examples from the help files (*.Rd) of
all core packages (base, eda, ..., ts) -- which can take quite long (a
few minutes, depending on your environment).

The "fast" part of the tests is `test-Specific' which runs the *.R
files in this (./tests) directory (tolerantly) compares the result
*.Rout file with the prespecified *.Rout.save (if that exists).  It
also runs a test abusing all the functions via no-segfault.R, and that
can be quite slow (a minute or more).

There are other useful make targets:

	make test-undoc
	make test-codoc

run undoc() and codoc() on base and all the standard packages.


	make test-Reg

runs regression tests, that is tests that ensure that things which have been
changed (perhaps as a result of bug reports) stay fixed.


	make test-Random

runs a series of tests on the distribution of random variates generated
by the rxxxx() functions.  The test is a large deviation bound on the 
Kolmogorov statistic, so also provides a test of the cumulative distribution
functions pxxxx().  Because rare events do happen, this test suite
will be failed in about 1 in 50 runs.


	make test-Internet

runs tests which need access to the Internet and/or sockets and so may
not run on every machine.  You will see some differences in the output,
but no test should fail if you do have sockets and Internet access.


	make test-Gct

runs a subset of the specific tests with gctorture turned on.  This is slow,
taking an hour or two.
