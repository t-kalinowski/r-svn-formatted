These files are shell and perl scripts used for configuring/building R.
They are not required at run time, and hence not installed.

The files are as follows.

  config.guess
  config.sub
  install-sh
  mdate-sh
  missing
	standard tools from GNU autoconf.  Taken from the autoconf CVS
	(pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/autoconf, module 
	'autoconf').

  GETCONFIG
	create API 'Rconfig.h' from the configure information in
	'config.h'.
  GETMAKEVAL
	get the value of a Make variable from a Makefile [this needs to
	be improved].
  GETVERSION
	create API 'Rversion.h' from 'VERSION' and 'date-stamp'.
  
  Rdnewer.pl
	determine whether any Rd file in an Rd tree is newer than a
	given file.
  
  copy-if-change
	copy a file if changed; otherwise, do nothing.

  help2man.pl
	generate simple manual pages from program output.  Taken from
	the GNU help2man package (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/help2man/).

	GNU/Linux stable distribution.

  keywords2html.pl

  linkcheck.pl
	comment out links that are not available.

  ltmain.sh

  pkg2tex.pl
	create a single 'PKGNAME-pkg.tex' file from the package docs in
