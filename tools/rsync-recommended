  ## The purpose of the rsync options is to get the timestamps on the
  ## downloaded files to reflect time of download.
  ## We can't use -t because then we could download a changed file that 
  ## was older the last build and therefore would not be installed. 
  ## The -c (checksum first) is necessary because otherwise all the 
  ## files get their mtime changed whether updated or not.
  ## -C prevents --delete from removing the CVS subdirectory.

  ## Link each package to a simplified name so that Make has an
  ## easier time. Notice that we cannot use pkgname.tgz because of
  ## the way R CMD INSTALL works, but pkgname_tgz works OK.
  ## Notice that as far as Make is concerned, the symlinks have the same
  ## timestamp as the file they point to.
